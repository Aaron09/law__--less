The dierence in the means, m1m0,Note that m1m0can be thought of as the dierence between the hypotheses due to the signal, and  is the standarddeviation of the noise. The error probabilities for the MAP rule can be obtained by substitutingin  = M AP in the above expressions.Example 3.10.2 Based on a sensor measurement X, it has to be decided which hypothesis abouta remotely monitored machine is true: H0: the machine is working vs. H1: the machine is broken.Suppose if H0 is true X is normal with mean 0 and variance a2, and if H1 is true X is normal withmean 0 and variance b2. Suppose a and b are known and that 0 < a < b. Find the ML decision rule,the MAP decision rule for a given choice of 0 and 1 and the error probabilities, pf alse alarm andpmiss, for both rules.Solution: To begin, we get as simple expression for the likelihood ratio as we can:u = u2e2b2 u22a2e12b12a u22b2 + u2e2a2 ==abu22  1a2  1b2 abeThe ML rule is to choose H1 when X > 1. Thus, by taking the natural logarithm of both sidesof this inequality we obtain the rule: If ln ab2  > 0 choose H1.
