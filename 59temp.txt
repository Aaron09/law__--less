That is, the exponential distributionwith parameter  has constant failure rate . The constant failure rate property is connected withthe memoryless property of the exponential distribution; the memoryless property implies thatP t < T  T + |T > t = PT  , which in view of the denition of h shows that h is constant.b If ht = t22 .

Therefore, the rate function for the minimum of two independent randomvariables is the sum of their failure rate functions. This makes intuitive sense; for a two-componentsystem that fails when either components fails, the rate of system failure is the sum of the rates ofcomponent failure.Example 3.9.2 Suppose the failure rate function for an item with lifetime T is ht =  for0  t <  and ht =  for t  1.

The failureFigure 3.24: Failure rate functions for a nearly constant lifetime and b an item with a burn-inperiod bath tub failure rate functionrate function in Figure 3.24a corresponds to the lifetime T being nearly deterministic, becausethe failure rate is very small until some xed time, and then it shoots up quickly at that time; withhigh probability, T is nearly equal to the time at which the failure rate function shoots up.The failure rate function in Figure 3.24b corresponds to an item with a signicant failurerate when the item is either new or suciently old. The large initial failure rate could be due tomanufacturing defects or a critical burn-in requirement, and the large failure rate for sucientlyold items could be a result of wear or fatigue.3.10 Binary hypothesis testing with continuous-type observationsSection 2.11 describes the binary hypothesis testing problem, with a focus on the case that theobservation X is discrete-type. There are two hypotheses, H1 and H0, and if hypothesis Hi is truethen the observation is assumed to have a pmf pi, for i = 1 or i = 0. The same framework worksfor continuous-type observations, as we describe in this section.Suppose f1 and f0 are two known pdfs, and suppose that if Hi is true, then the observationX is a continuous-type random variable with pdf fi. If a particular value of X is observed, thedecision rule has to specify which hypothesis to declare. For continuous-type random variables,the probability that X = u is zero for any value of u, for either hypothesis. But recall that if  issmall, then fiu is the approximate probability that the observation is within a length  intervalcentered at u, if Hi is the true hypothesis. For this reason, we still call fiu the likelihood of X = uif Hi is the true hypothesis. We also dene the likelihood ratio, u, for u in the support of f1 orf0, byu =f1uf0u.htbathtt3.10.
