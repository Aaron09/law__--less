whereXi is one if the ith bit in the array is in error, and Xi = 0 otherwise. By assumption, the randomvariables X1, . . . , X64 are independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter p = 0.001, so Yis a binomial random variable with parameters n = 64 and p = 0.001. The event Y  4 can beiA PXi = 1 = p4.expressed as the union of cid:064A of 1, . . . , n with |A| = 4. For such an A, PXi = 1 for all i  A = cid:81So the union bound with m = cid:064cid:1p41  p60. Thus,PY = 4 =cid:064cid:1 events of the form Xi = 1 for all i  A, indexed by the subsetscid:1p4. This is in contrast to the factcid:1 yields PY  4  cid:0644444cid:1864cid:194P undetected errors  PY  4 p4 = 635376p4 = 0.635376  106.A considerably tighter bound can be obtained with a little more work. Four errors go undetectedif and only if they are at the intersection points of two columns and two rows. There arecid:08ways to choose two columns andcid:08cid:1 = 28cid:1 = 28 ways to choose two rows, so there are 282 = 784 error2patterns with four errors that go undetected. The probability of any given one of those patternsoccurring is less than p4, so by the union bound, the probability that the actual error pattern is anundetected pattern of four bit errors is less than or equal to 784p4. Any pattern of ve bit errorsis detected because any pattern with an odd number of bit errors is detected. So the only otherway undetected errors can occur is if Y  6, and PY  6 can again be bounded by the union274CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESbound.

Suppose each day, given a machine was up the day before or was nished being repairedthe day before or that it is the rst day, the machine is up on the given day with probability 0.999and it goes down with probability 0.001. If a machine goes down on a given day, then the machinestays down for repair for a total of ve days. The two machines go up and down independently.We would like to estimate the mean time until there is a day such that both machines are down.This is a challenging problem. Can you show that the mean time until outage is between 200and 400 years? Here is a reasonably accurate solution. Given both machines were working the daybefore, or were just repaired, or it is the rst day, the probability that at least one of them failson a given day is about 0.002. That is, the waiting time until at least one machine goes down isapproximately geometrically distributed with parameter p = 0.002. The mean of such a distributionis 1/p, so the mean time until at least one of the machines goes down is about 500 days. Given thatone machine goes down, the probability the other machine goes down within the ve day repairtime is about 5/1000=1/200. That is, the number of repair cycles until a double outage occurshas a geometric distribution with parameter about 1/200, so on average, well have to wait for 200cycles, each averaging about 500 days. Therefore, the mean total waiting time until double outageis about 500  200 = 100, 000 days, or approximately 274 years.2.13 Short Answer QuestionsSection 2.2video1.
