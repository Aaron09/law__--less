 1.3.6 How many binary sequences of length 9 have exactly 5 ones? One such sequenceis 110110010.If the ones were distinct and the zeros were distinct, there would be 9! choices. ButSolution:there are 5! ways to order the ones, and for each of those, 4! ways to order the zeros, so there are5! 4! orderings with labels for each ordering without labels. Thus, the number of binary sequencesof length 9 having ve ones is 9!5!4! . This is the same as the solution to Example 1.3.5. In fact, thereis a one-to-one correspondence between lineups and binary sequences of length 9 with 5 ones. Thepositions of the 1s indicate which players are in the lineup. The sequence 110110010 correspondsto the lineup A, B, D, E, H.3ILLINI, pronounced ill LIE nigh, is the nickname for the students and others at the University of Illinois.1.4. PROBABILITY EXPERIMENTS WITH EQUALLY LIKELY OUTCOMES13In general, the number of subsets of size k of a set of n distinct objects can be determined asfollows. There are n ways to select the rst object, n  1 ways to select the second object, andso on, until there are n  k + 1 ways to select the kth object. By the principle of counting, thatgives a total count of nn  1 n  k + 1, but this chooses k distinct objects in a particularorder. By denition of the word set, the order of the elements within a set does not matter.Each set of k objects is counted k! ways by this method, so by the principle of over counting, thenumber of subsets of size k of a set of n distinct objects with the order not mattering is given bynn1nk+1nk!k! , and is called n choose k, and is written as the binomial.

Someone selects two at random, all possibilities beingequally likely. What is the probability the two socks are the same color? Also, if instead, threesocks were selected, what is the probability that at least two of them are the same color?Solution For the rst question, we could imagine the socks are numbered one through nine, withsocks numbered one through six being orange and and socks numbered seven through nine beingblue. Let  be the set of all subsets of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of size two. The number of elements2 = 36. The number of ways two orange socks could be chosen isof  is given by || =cid:09cid:1 = 98214cid:1 = 15, and the number of ways two blue socks could be chosen iscid:03cid:062two socks chosen at random have the same color is 15+3CHAPTER 1. FOUNDATIONScid:1 = 3. Thus, the probability236 = 1/2.The second question is trivial. Whatever set of three socks is selected, at least two of them arethe same color. So the answer to the second question is one.Example 1.4.2 Let an experiment consist of rolling two fair dice, and dene the following threeevents about the numbers showing: A =sum is even, B =sum is a multiple of three, andC =the numbers are the same. Display the outcomes in a three-event Karnaugh map, and ndP ABC.Solution. We write ij for the outcome such that i appears on the rst die and j appears on thesecond die. The outcomes are displayed in a Karnaugh map in Figure 1.2. It is a little tedious to llin the map, but it is pretty simple to check correctness of the map. For correctness it suces thatFigure 1.2: Karnaugh map for the roll of two fair dice and events A, B, and C.for each of the events A, Ac, B, Bc, C, Cc, the correct outcomes appear in the corresponding linesrows or columns. For example, all 18 outcomes in A are in the bottom row of the map. All 18outcomes of Ac are in the upper row of the map. Similarly we can check for B, Bc, C, and Cc. Thereare 36 elements in , and ABC = 33, 66, which has two outcomes. So P ABC = 2/36 = 1/18.Example 1.4.3 video video Suppose a deck of playing cards has 52 cards, represented by theset C :C = 1C, 2C, . . . , 13C, 1D, 2D, . . . , 13D, 1H, 2H, . . . 13H, 1S, 2S, . . . , 13S.Here C, D, H, or S stands for the suit of a card: clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spades.Suppose ve cards are drawn at random from the deck, with all possibilities being equally likely.CAAccBBCCcc33,6614,16,23,2532,34,41,43,52,56,61,6512,21,36, 1.3.6 How many binary sequences of length 9 have exactly 5 ones?
