First and second moments of a ternary random variable This problem focuses on the possible mean and variance of a random variable X with supportset 1, 0, 1. Let pX 1 = a and pX 1 = b and pX 0 = 1  a  b. This is a valid pmf ifand only if a  0, b  0, and a + b  1. Let  = EX, 2 = VarX, and m2 = EX 2.a Find a, b so that  = 12 and 2 = 34 .b Express a and b in terms of  and m2. Determine and sketch the region of , m2 pairsfor which there is a valid choice of a, b.c Determine and sketch the set of , 2 pairs for which there is a valid choice of a, b.Hint: For  xed, the set of possible values of 2 is the set of possible values of m22.2.11. Producing some simple empirical distributions by computer simulationThis problem is intended to be solved using a computer.a Write a computer program that can simulate N independent rolls of a fair die for anyinteger value of N that you put into the program. Display the empirical distribution,where the empirical distribution for such an experiment is the fraction of rolls that areone, the fraction of rolls that are two, and so on, up to the fraction of rolls that are six,for N = 100, N = 1000 and N = 10, 000. Your program output should look somethinglike the histograms shown.b Run your program at least twenty times; the displayed triplet of empirical distributionsshould change each time. See how much the distributions change from one simulationto the next, for each of the three values of N. The empirical distribution for the caseN = 100 can often be far from uniform. Here is what to turn in for this part: Find,print out, and turn in the printout, for an example triplet of plots produced by theprogram such that the rst empirical distribution i.e. the one for N = 100 is far fromthe uniform one.c Produce a modication of the program so that for each N , two dice are rolled N times,and for each time the sum of the two dice is recorded. The empirical distributions willthus have support over the range from 2 to 12. Print out and turn in a gure showingempirical distributions for N = 100, N = 1000, and N = 10000, and also turn in a copyof the computer code you used. Hint: Even though the sum of two dice is always atleast 2, it might be easier to make the plot if one of the bins for the histogram is centeredat one; the count for such bin will always be zero.Conditional probability, independence, and the binomial distributionSections 2.32.42.12.

Coincidence of birth monthsThere are three persons in a room. Find the probability that at least two persons havethe same birth-month. For simplicity, assume that each of the twelve possibilities for thebirth-month of a given person are equally likely.2.14. IndependenceSuppose two dice, one orange and one blue, are rolled. Dene the following events:A: The product of the two numbers that show is 12B: The number on the orange die is strictly larger than the number on the blue die.C: The sum of the numbers is divisible by four.D: The number on the orange die is either 1 or 3.a List all pairs of events from the set A, B, C, and D that are independent.b List all triplets of events, if any, from the set of A, B, C, and D, that are mutuallyindependent.2.15.
