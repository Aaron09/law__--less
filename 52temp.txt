andom variables, each having thesame parameter p. In other words, when X has the binomial distribution, with parameters n and p.The approximation is most accurate if both np and n1  p are at least moderately large, and theprobabilities being approximated are not extremely close to zero or one. As an example, supposeX has the binomial distribution with parameters n = 10 and p = 0.2. Then EX = np = 2 andVarX = np1 p = 1.6. Let cid:101X be a Gaussian random variable with the same mean and varianceas X. The CDFs of X and cid:101X are shown in Figure 3.11. The two CDFs cannot be close everywherebecause the CDF of X is piecewise constant with jumps at integer points, and the CDF of cid:101X isbetween two consecutive integers. For example, PX  2.5 = 0.6778 and Pcid:101X  2.5 = 0.6537.continuous. Notice, however, that the functions are particularly close when the argument is halfwaySince X is an integer-valued random variable, PX  2.5 = PX  2. Therefore, we have:PX  2 = PX  2.5  Pcid:101X  2.5.So, Pcid:101X  2.5 is a fairly good approximation to PX  2. In particular, it is a better approx-imation than Pcid:101X  2 isin this case Pcid:101X  2 = 0.5. In general, when X is an integer-valued120CHAPTER 3.

The approximation improves as n increases. The CDFn = 30 and p = 0.2.As mentioned earlier, the Gaussian approximation is backed by various forms of the central limittheorem CLT. Historically, the rst version of the CLT proved is the following theorem, whichpertains to the case of binomial distributions. Recall that if n is a positive integer and 0 < p < 1,a binomial random variable Sn,p with parameters n and p has mean np and variance np1  p.Therefore, the standardized version of Sn,p is Sn,pnpnp1p.Theorem 3.6.7 DeMoivre-Laplace limit theorem Suppose Sn,p is a binomial random variablewith parameters n and p.

LINEAR SCALING OF PDFS AND THE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION121Figure 3.12: The CDF of a binomial random variable with parameters n = 30 and p = 0.2, and theGaussian approximation of it.The practical implication of the DeMoivre-Laplace limit theorem is that, for large n, the standard-ized version of Sn,p has approximately the standard normal distribution, or equivalently, that Sn,phas approximately the same CDF as a Gaussian random variable with the same mean and variance.That is, the DeMoivre-Laplace limit theorem gives evidence that the Gaussian approximation tothe binomial distribution is a good one. A more general version of the CLT is stated in Section4.10.2.Example 3.6.8 a Suppose a fair coin is ipped a thousand times, and let X denote the numberof times heads shows. Using the Gaussian approximation with the continuity correction,5 nd theapproximate numerical value K so PX  K  0.01. b Repeat, but now assume the coin isipped a million times.p = 0.5. It thus has mean X = np = 500 and standard deviation  =cid:112np1  p =cid:18 K  0.5  a The random variable X has the binomial distribution with parameters n = 1000 and250  15.8.By the Gaussian approximation with the continuity correction,cid:26 X  Solution:cid:27PX  K = PX  K  0.5 = P K  0.5   Qcid:19.Since Q2.325  0.01 we thus want to select K so K0.5 2.325 or K =  + 2.325 + 0.5 =537.26. Thus, K = 537 or K = 538 should do. So, if the coin is ipped a thousand times, there isabout a one percent chance that heads shows for more than 53.7% of the ips.5Use of the continuity correction is specied here to be denite, although n is so large that the continuity correctionis not very important.122CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESb By the same reasoning, we should take K   + 2.325 + 0.5, where, for n = 106,  = 500000250, 000 = 500. Thus, K = 501163 should do. So, if the coin is ipped a million times,and  =there is about a one percent chance that heads shows for more than 50.12% of the ips.Example 3.6.9 Suppose a testing service is to administer a standardized test at a given locationon a certain test date, and only students who have pre
