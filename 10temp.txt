Thus,  is countablyinnite. Mathematically, the case that  is countably innite is similar to the case  is nite. Inparticular, we can continue to let F, the set of events, be the set of all subsets of . To name aspecic choice of a probability measure P, we use the following rather arbitrary choice. Letp1, p2, p3, . . . =1  12,12 13,13 14, . . .=,16,112,1202, . . .,ii+1 for i  1. Note that p1 +  + pi = 1  1any event A can be listed in a sequence, Axiom P.2 requires that for any event A, P A =cid:80i+1 for i  1 and thereforeor, equivalently, pi = 1p1 +p2 + = 1. Assume that the player chooses integer i with probability pi. Since the outcomes iniA pi.For example, P1, 4, 5 = 130  0.8533. If A is the event that the number chosen is amultiple of ve, then P A can be calculated numerically:20 + 12 + 1P A =1+1+1+   0.057631516This choice of ,F, P  satises the axioms of probability.101156It is often natural and convenient to consider probability experiments involving real-valuedoutcomes. Even though there are uncountably many possible outcomes, the axioms of probabilitycan still model such situations, as illustrated in the following three examples of probability spaces.Example 1.5.3 Standard unit-interval probability space Take  =  : 0    1. Imaginean experiment in which the outcome  is drawn from , with no preference for drawing from oneinterval or another, for two intervals of the same length. This requires the set of events F to includeintervals, and the probability of an interval a, b with 0  a  b  1 to be given byP  a, b  = b  a.1.3Taking a = b, we see that singleton sets a are events, and these sets have probability zero. Inorder for the event axioms to be true, open intervals a, b must also be events and P  a, b  = ba.Any open subset of  can be expressed as the union of a nite or countably innite set of openintervals, and any closed set is the the complement of an open set, so F should contain all openand all closed subsets of . Thus, F must contain any set that is the intersection of countablymany open sets, and so on.18CHAPTER 1. FOUNDATIONSsets are mutually exclusive. Why then, doesnt Axiom P.2 imply that P =cid:80Example 1.5.3 describes the probability space ,F, P  for the experiment of selecting a pointfrom the unit interval, 0, 1, such that the probability the outcome is in an interval a, b is b  a.This is true even if a = b, which means that the probability of any particular singleton subset xof 0, 1 is equal to zero. But the entire interval 0, 1 is the union of all such sets x, and thosex Px = 0,in contradiction to Axiom P.3? The answer is that Axiom P.2 does not apply to this situationbecause it only holds for a nite or countably innite collection of events, whereas the set 0, 1 isuncountably innite.The next two examples make use of the formula for the sum of a geometric series, so we derivethe formula here. A geometric series with rst term one has the form 1, x, x2, x3, . Equivalently,the kth term is xk for k  0. Observe that for any value of x :1  x1 + x + x2 +  + xn = 1  xn+1,because when the product on the left hand side is expanded, the terms of the form xk for 1  k  ncancel out. Therefore, for x cid:54= 1, the following equivalent expressions hold for the partial sums ofa geometric series:1 + x + x2 +  + xn =1  xn+11  xorxk =1  xn+11  x.1.4ncid:88k=0cid:88k=0The sum of an innite series is equal to the limit of the nth partial sum as n  . If |x| < 1 thenlimn xn+1 = 0. So letting n   in 1.4 yields that for |x| < 1 :1 + x + x2 +  =11  xorxk =11  x.1.5The formula 1.4 for partial sums and the formula 1.5 for innite sums of a geometric series areused frequently in these notes.Example 1.5.4 Repeated binary trials Suppose we would like to represent an innite sequenceof binary observations, where each observation is a zero or one with equal probability. For example,the experiment could consist of repeatedly ipping a fair coin, and recording a one each time itshows heads and a zero each time it shows tails. Then an outcome  would be an innite sequence, = 1, 2, , such that for each i  1, i  0, 1. Let  be the set of all such s. The set ofevents can be taken to be large enough so that any set that can be dened in terms of only nitelymany of the observations is an event. In particular, for any binary sequence b1, , bk of somenite length k, the set    : i = bi for 1  i  k should be in F, and the probability of sucha set is taken to be 2k.There are also events that dont depend on a xed, nite number of observations. For example,suppose there are two players who take turns performing the coin ips, with the rst one to getheads wins. Let F be the event that the player going rst wins. Show that F is an event and thennd its probability.1.5.
