The equivalent equations 3.3 and 3.43.4Many of the denitions and properties for discrete-type random variables carry over to continuous-type random variables, with summation replaced by integration. The mean or expectation, EX,of a continuous-type random variable X is dened by:cid:90 cid:90 X = EX =ufX udu.EgX =gufX udu.The Law of the Unconscious Statistician LOTUS holds and is the fact that for a function g:It follows from LOTUS, just as in the case of discrete-type random variables, that expectation is alinear operation. For example, EaX 2 + bX + c = aEX 2 + bEX + c.Variance is dened for continuous-type random variables exactly as it is for discrete-type randomvariables: VarX = EXX 2, and it has the same properties. It is a measure of how spread outthe distribution of X is. As before, the variance of X is often denoted by 2is called the standard deviation of X. If X is a measurement in some units, then X is in the sameunits. For example.if X represents a measurement in feet, then VarX represents a number offeet2 and X represents a number of feet. Exactly as shown in Section 2.2 for discrete-type randomvariables, the variance for continuous-type random variables scales as VaraX + b = a2VarX.The standardized random variable, XX, is a dimensionless random variable with mean zero andvariance one.X , where X =cid:112VarXXFinally, as before, the variance of a random variable is equal to its second moment minus thesquare of its rst moment:VarX = EX 2  2X X + 2X X= EX 2  2X EX + 2= EX 2  2X .cid:26 A1  u2 1  u  10else.fX u =Find A, P0.5 < X < 1.5, FX , X , VarX, and X .Example 3.2.2 Suppose X has the following pdf, where A is a constant to be determined:102CHAPTER 3.
