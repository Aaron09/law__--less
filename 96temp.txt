APPENDIX6.6 Solutions to even numbered problems1.2. Dening a set of outcomes IIa One choice would be  = w1, w2, w3 : w1  1, 2, w2  3, 4, w3  w1, w2, wherewi denotes which team wins the ith game, for 1  i  3.Another choice would be  = x1, x2, x3 : xi  L, H for 1  i  3, where xiindicates which of the two teams playing the ith game wins; xi = H indicates that thehigher numbered team wins and xi = L indicates that the lower numbered team wins.For example, L, L, H indicates that team one wins the rst game, team three wins thesecond game so team one plays team three in the third game, and team three wins thethird game.b Eight, because there are two possible outcomes for each of the three games, and 23 = 8.c There are three possible tournament brackets , which can be indexed by j  2, 3, 4, withj indicating which team plays team 1 in the rst round. For each possible bracket thereare eight possible outcomes for the games, as in part b. So, accounting for the possiblebrackets, there are 24 possible outcomes of the tournament. We could represent themby four tuples of the form  = j; x1, x2, x3 : j  2, 3, 4, xi  L, H for 1  i  3.where j represents the team playing team 1 in the rst round, and the xis have thesame meaning as explained in part a.d There are eight outcomes in which teams 1 and 2 play each other in the rst round,namely, the outcomes with j = 2. There are two outcomes with j = 3 for which teams1 and 2 play each other in the second round, namely 3; L, L, L and 3; L, L, H. Thatis, they must both win in the rst round, and then either one could win when they playeach other. Similarly, there are two outcomes with j = 4 for which teams 1 and 2 playeach other in the second round, namely 4; L, L, L and 4; L, L, H. So overall, teams 1and 2 play each other in 12 out of the 24 outcomes. If all outcomes are equally likely,the probability the teams play each other is one half.1.4. Possible probability assignmentsThis is one of many ways to get the answer. Since, by De Morgans law, the complementof A  B is AcBc, the fact P A  B = 0.6 is equivalent to P AcBc = 0.4. Thus, we can llin the Karnaugh diagram for A and B as shown:We lled in the variable a for P ABc, and then, since the sum of the probabilities is one, itmust be that P AcB = 0.3  a. The valid values of a are 0  a  0.3, and P A, P B =0.3 + a, 0.6 a. So, in parametric form, the set of possible values of P A, P B is 0.3 +0.3BcAAcB0.30.4a  !a6.6.

A classication of students in a classSet up a Karnaugh map using F for Facebook, I for iPad, and T for Twitter, and beginlling in entries by considering the given facts in the following order: 3 students on Facebook and having iPads are not on Twitter 2 students are on both Facebook and Twitter and have iPads 9 are on both Facebook and Twitter 12 are not on Facebook so 18 are on Facebook; all numbers inside F can be lled in,and the sum of the other four numbers is 12 2/3 of the students not on Facebook and without iPads are on Twitter; enter a and 2ain boxes as shown below in leftmost diagram. 2/3 of students not on Twitter dont have iPads; Enter b for the number in F cIT c asshow in the leftmost diagram, and then a + 6 = 2b + 3 or a = 2b..
