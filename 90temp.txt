Whats new? or the innovations methodThe problem above on linear MSE estimation from uncorrelated observations shows thatif Y is to be estimated by a linear combination of X1 and X2, the solution is particularlysimple if CovX1, X2 = 0. Intuitively, that is because, even if X1 is already known, X2 oerscompletely new information. If CovX1, X2 cid:54= 0, then by preprocessing, we can reduce theproblem to the previous case. The idea is to let cid:102X2 = X2  hX1, where the constant h ischosen so that X1 a
