As in the special case ofWe shall discuss next how joint pdfs are transformed for possibly nonlinear functions. Specically,linear transformations, think of the mapping as going from the u  v plane to the    plane.Therefore, for each u, v, there corresponds a point , . This can be written as:  = g1u, vand  = g2u, v, where g1 and g2 are the two coordinate functions of g, each mapping R2 to R.
