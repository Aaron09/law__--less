A, P B, so the bound is never larger than two times P A B. Betteryet, if A and B are independent and have small probabilities, then P AB = P AP B cid:28 P ABhere cid:28 means much smaller than. For example, if P A = P B = 0.001 and A and B areindependent, then P A  B = 0.002  0.000001 which is very close to the union bound, 0.002.The union bound can be extended from a bound on the union of two events to a bound on theunion of m events for any m  2. The union bound on the probability of the union of a set of mevents isP A1  A2    Am  P A1 + P A2 +  + P Am.2.18The union bound for m events follows from the union bound for two events and argument byinduction on m. The union bound is applied in the following sections.2.12.2 Network outage probabilityThe network outage problem addressed here is one of many dierent ways to describe and analyzesystem reliability involving serial and parallel subsystems. An s  t network consists of a sourcenode s, a terminal node t, possibly some additional nodes, and some links that connect pairs ofnodes. Figure 2.12 pictures ve such networks, network A through network E. Network A has twolinks, link 1 and link 2, in parallel. Network B has two links in series. Network C has two parallelpaths, with each path consisting of two links in series. Network D has two stages of two parallellinks. Network E has ve links.Suppose each link i fails with probability pi. Let Fi be the event that link i fails. So pi = P Fi.Assume that for a given network, the links fail independently. That is, the Fis are independentevents. Network outage is said to occur if at least one link fails along every s  t path, where ans  t path is a set of links that connect s to t. Let F denote the event of network outage. We will68CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESFigure 2.12: Five s  t networks with associated outage probabilities.nd P F  for each of the ve networks, and then apply the union bound to get a simple upperbound to P F  for networks B through E.Exact calculation of network outage Network A has two s  t paths: the path consisting oflink 1 alone, and the path consisting of link 2 alone. Therefore, network outage happens if andonly if both links fail. Thus, for network A, F = F1F2. By the assumption that F1 and F2 areindependent, P F  = p1p2. For example, if p1 = p2 = 103, then P F  = 106. That is, if eachlink fails with probability one in a thousand, the network outage probability is one in a million.Network B has only one s t path, consisting of both links 1 and 2. Therefore, outage occurs innetwork B if link 1 fails or if link 2 fails. So for network B, F = F1 F2, and P F  = p1 + p2 p1p2.Notice that if p1 and p2 are both very small, then p1p2 is small compared to p1 + p2. For example,if p1 = p2 = 103, then P F  = 2  103  106 = 0.001999  0.002.Network C is similar to network A. Like network A, network C has two s  t paths in parallel,but for network C, each path consists of two links in series. The upper path has links 1 and 2,and the event the upper path fails is F1  F2, which has probability p1 + p2  p1p2. Similarly, thelower path has links 3 and 4, and the event the lower path fails is F3  F4, which has probabilityp3 + p4  p3p4. Since the two s  t paths involve separate sets of links, the event the upper pathfails is independent of the event the lower path fails. So the network outage probability is theproduct of the failure probabilities for the upper and lower paths. That is, for network C, P F  =p1 + p2  p1p2p3 + p4  p3p4. If pi = 0.001 for all i, P F  = 0.0019992  .000004.Network D is similar to network B. Like network B, network D has two stages in series,but each stage of network D consists of two links in parallel instead of only a single link perstage. Outage occurs in network D if and only if either the rst stage fails or the second stagefails. The rst stage has links 1 and 3, and the event the rst stage fails can be written as F1F3,which has probability p1p3. Similarly, the second stage has links 2 and 4, and the event that the2.12. RELIABILITY69second stage fails can be written as F2F4, which has probability p2p4. Since the two stages involveseparate sets of links, the rst stage fails independently of the second stage. So the network outageprobability is Prst stage fails+Psecond stage failsPboth stages fail. That is, for networkD, P F  = p1p3 + p2p4 p1p2p3p4. If pi = 0.001 for all i, P F   0.000002, or about half the outageprobability for network C.Finally, consider network E. One way to approach the computation of P F  is to use thelaw of total probability, and consider two cases: either link 5 fails or it doesnt fail. So P F  =P F|F5P F5 + F F|F c5 . Now P F|F5 is the network outage probability if link 5 fails. Iflink 5 fails we can erase it from the picture, and the remaining network is identical to network C.So P F|F5 for Network E is equal to P F  for network C. If link 5 does not fail, the networkbecomes equivalent to network D. So P F|F c5  for Network E is equal to P F  for A, P B, so the bound is never larger than two times P A B. Betteryet, if A and B are independent and have small probabilities, then P AB = P AP B cid:28 P ABhere cid:28 means much smaller than. For example, if P A = P B = 0.001 and A and B areindependent, then P A  B = 0.002  0.000001 which is very close to the union bound, 0.002.The union bound can be extended from a bound on the union of two events to a bound on theunion of m events for any m  2.
