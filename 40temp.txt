The weight of a positiveBased on G. Gigerenzer, Calculated Risks, Simon and Schuster, 2002 and S. Strogatz NYTarticle, April 25, 2010. Women aged 40 to 49 years of age have a low incidence of breast can-cer; the fraction is estimated at 0.8%. Given a woman with breast cancer has a mammogram,the probability of detection i.e. a positive mammogram is estimated to be 90%. Given awoman does not have breast cancer, the probability of a false positive i.e a false alarm isestimated to be 7%.a Based on the above numbers, given a woman aged 40 to 49 has a mammogram, what isthe probability the mammogram will be positive?b Given a woman aged 40 to 49 has a positive mammogram, what is the conditionalprobability the woman has breast cancer?c For 1000 women aged 40 to 49 getting mammograms for the rst time, how many areexpected to have breast cancer, for how many of those is the mammogram positive, andhow many are expected to get a false positive?2.33. Which airline was late?Three airlines y out of the Bloomington airport: American has ve ights per day; 20% depart late, AirTrans has four ights per day; 5% depart late, Delta has nine ights per day; 10% depart late.a What fraction of ights ying out of the Bloomington airport depart late?b Given that a randomly selected ight departs late with all ights over a long period oftime being equally likely to be selected what is the probability the ight is an Americanight?2.34. Conditional distribution of half-way pointConsider a robot taking a random walk on the integer line. The robot starts at zero at timezero. After that, between any two consecutive integer times, the robot takes a unit length88CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESleft step or right step, with each possibility having probability one half. Let F denote theevent that the robot is at zero at time eight, and let X denote the location of the robot attime four.a Find P F .b Find the pmf of X.c Find P X = iF  for all integer values of i. For what values of i is P X = iF  > 0?d Find the conditional pmf of X given that F is true. It is natural to use the notationpX i|F  for this, and it is dened by pX i|F  = P X = i|F  for all integers i. Is theconditional pmf more spread out than the unconditional pmf pX , or more concentrated?2.35. Matching Poisson meansConsider hypotheses H0 and H1 about a two dimensional observation vector X = X1, X2.Under H0, X1 and X2 are mutually independent, and both have the Poisson distribution withmean 4. Under H1, X1 and X2 are mutually independent, X1 has the Poisson distributionwith mean 2, and X2 has the Poisson distribution with mean 6.a Describe the ML rule for H0 vs. H1. Display your answer by indicating how to partitionthe set of possible observations, i, j : i  0, j  0, into two sets, 0 and 1, for whichthe decision is H0 if X1, X2  0 and H1 if X1, X2  1.b Describe the MAP rule for H0 vs. H1, assuming the prior distribution with 01= 2.Display your answer by indicating how to partition the set of possible observations,i, j : i  0, j  0, into two sets, 0 and 1, for which the decision is H0 if X1, X2 0 and H1 if X1, X2  1.2.36.

Each judge votes yes or no by secretballot; each judge votes yes with some probability p, where 0 < p < 1; the votes of the judgesare mutually independent; the majority rules. Let M be the event that the decision of thepanel is yes i.e. a majority of the judges vote yes and let A denote the event that the rstjudge votes yes.2.14.
