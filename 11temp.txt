Thatis, Ek is the event that the rst k observations are given by the binary sequence b1, . . . , bk =0, 0, . . . , 0, 1, and its probability is given by PEk = 2k.Observe that F = E1 E3 E5 . . . , so F is an event by Axiom E.3.

Since T is not rectangular, itis not immediately clear whether T is an event.

FOUNDATIONSThe set of squares is countably innite, and their union is T , so T is an event by Axiom E.3. Sincethe square regions are mutually exclusive, Axiom P.2 implies that P T  is equal to the sum of theareas of the squares:P T  = 1/4 + 21/42 + 221/43 + 231/44 + = 1/41 + 21 + 22 + 23 +  = 1/4  2 = 1/2.Of course, it is reasonable that P T  = 1/2, because T takes up half of the area of the square. Infact, any reasonable subset of the square is an event, and the probability of any event A is the areaof A.1.6 Short Answer QuestionsSection 1.2video1.
