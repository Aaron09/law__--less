5: Results of simulation of sums of independent random variables, uniformly distributedon 0, 1. a Sn vs. n. b Sn vs. n.Example 4.10.2 Suppose a fair die is rolled 1000 times. What is a rough approximation to thesum of the numbers showing, based on the law of large numbers?Solution: The sum is S1000 = X1 + X2 +  + X1000, where Xk denotes the number showing onthe kth roll. Since EXk = 1+2+3+4+5+6= 3.5, the expected value of S1000 is 10003.5 = 3500.By the law of large numbers, we expect the sum to be near 3500.6Example 4.10.3 Suppose X1, . . . , X100 are random variables, each with mean  = 5 and variance2 = 1. Suppose also that |CovXi, Xj|  0.1 if i = j  1, and CovXi, Xj = 0 if |i  j|  2. LetS100 = X1 +  + X100.a Show that VarS100  120.b Use part a and Chebychevs inequality to nd an upper bound on P | S100100  5|  0.5.4.10.

Thus, by Chebychevsi=24.10.2 Central limit theoremThe following version of the central limit theorem CLT generalizes the DeMoivre-Laplace limittheorem, discussed in Section 3.6.3. While the DeMoivre-Laplace limit theorem pertains to sums ofindependent, identically distributed Bernoulli random variables, the version here pertains to sumsof independent, identically distributed random variables with any distribution, so long as theirmean and variance are nite.Theorem 4.10.4 Central limit theorem Suppose X1, X2, . . . are independent, identically dis-tributed random variables, each with mean  and variance 2. Let Sn = X1 +  + Xn. Then:cid:26 Sn  nn2cid:27 c= c.limn PThe practical implication of the central limit theorem is the same as that of the DeMoivre-Laplacelimit theorem. That is, the CLT gives evidence that the Gaussian approximation, discussed inSection 3.6.3, is a good one, for sums of independent, identically distributed random variables.Figure 4.26 illustrates the CLT for the case the Xks are uniformly distributed on the interval 0, 1.The approximation in this case is so good that some simulation programs generate Gaussian randomvariables by generating six uniformly distributed random variables and adding them together toproduce one approximately Gaussian random variable.Example 4.10.5 Let S denote the sum of the numbers showing in 1000 rolls of a fair die. Bythe law of large numbers, S is close to 3500 with high probability. Find the number L so thatP|S  3500|  L  0.9. To be denite, use the continuity correction.214CHAPTER 4. JOINTLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM VARIABLESFigure 4.26: Comparison of the pdf of Sn to the Gaussian pdf with the same mean and variance,for sums of uniformly distributed random variables on 0, 1. For n = 3 and n = 4, the Gaussianpdf is the one with a slightly higher peak.Solution: As noted in Example 2.4.10, the number showing for one roll of a die has mean  = 3.5and variance 2 = 2.9167. Therefore, S has mean 3500, variance 2916.7, and standard deviation2916.7 = 54.01.

Assume the individual roundo errors are independent and uniformly distributed over theinterval 0.5, 0.5. Using the Gaussian approximation suggested by the CLT, nd the approximateprobability that the absolute value of the sum of the errors is greater than 5.4.10.

Changes on dierent days are independent. Consider the value after one year365 days, beginning with one unit of stock. Find a the probability the stock at least triplesin value, b the probability the stock at least quadruples in value, c the median value after oneyear.Solution: The value, Y , after one year, is given by Y = D1D2  D365, where Dk for each k is thegrowth factor for day k, with pmf pD1.01 = 0.5, pD1 = 0.4, pD0.99 = 0.1.
