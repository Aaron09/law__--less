 exponentially distributed with parameter  = 0.01. Let S denote the samewaiting time, but measured in minutes. Find the mean and the pdf of S.Solution: First we identify the pdf and mean of T. By denition of the exponential distributionwith parameter  = 0.01, the pdf of T iscid:26 0.01e0.01u0for u  0for u < 0,fT u =where the variable u is a measure of time in seconds. The mean of an exponentially distributedrandom variable with parameter  is 1 , so ET  = 10.01 = 100.The waiting time in minutes is given by S = T60 =10060 = 1.66 . . . . That is, the mean waiting time is 100 seconds, or 1.666 . . . minutes. By the scalingformula with a = 1/60 and b = 0,60 . By the linearity of expectation, ES = ET cid:26 600.01e0.0160v = 0.6e0.6vfor v  0for v < 0,fSv = fT 60v60 =0where v is a measure of time in minutes. Examining this pdf shows that S is exponentially dis-tributed with parameter 0.60. From this fact, we can nd the mean of S a second wayit is oneover the parameter in the exponential distribution for S, namely 10.6 = 1.666 . . . , as already noted.Example 3.6.3 Let X be a uniformly distributed random variable on some interval a, b.

LINEAR SCALING OF PDFS AND THE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION1153Solution The mean, X , is the midpoint of the interval a, b, and the standard deviation isX = basee Section 3.3. The pdf for X  X is obtained by shifting the pdf of X to be2centered at zero. Thus, X  X is uniformly distributed over the interval  ba2 . When thisrandom variable is divided by X , the resulting pdf is shrunk horizontally by the factor X . Thisresults in a uniform distribution over the interval  babecause the uniform distribution over the interval 3. This makes sense,2X2X3,3 is the unique uniform distribution = 2 , ba, ba3,with mean zero and variance one.3.6.2 The Gaussian normal distributionThe Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, has the pdfcid:18 u  2cid:19,22f u =122expwhere the parameters are  and 2. The distribution is often denoted by N , 2 distribution,which is read aloud as the normal , 2 distribution. Later in this section it is shown that thepdf integrates to one, the mean is , and the variance is 2. The pdf is pictured in Figure 3.10. TheFigure 3.10: The Gaussian or normal pdfparameter  is sometimes called the location parameter, because the pdf is symmetric around thevalue . The eect of replacing  by  + 3, for example, would be to slide the pdf to the right bythree units. The parameter  is sometimes called the scale parameter. As indicated in the gure,the width of the graph of the pdf is proportional to . For example, about 68.3% of the probabilitymass is in the interval   ,  +  and roughly 95% more precisely, 95.44% of the distributionis in the interval   2,  + 2. The peak height of the pdf is122 . The height is inverselyproportional to  as expected, so for small  the graph is tall and narrow, and for large  it is shortand spread out, but for all  the area under the pdf is one.The standard normal distribution is the normal distribution with  = 0 and 2 = 1. It is alsocalled the N 0, 1 distribution. The CDF of the N 0, 1 distribution is traditionally denoted by theletter  Phi:cid:90 ucid:18cid:19u =12exp v22dv,2! 12.3%13.6%68.3%116CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESand the complementary CDF of the N 0, 1 distribution is traditionally denoted by the letter Q,at least in much of the systems engineering literature. Socid:90 uQu =cid:18cid:1912exp v22dv = 1  u = u.Since Qu = 1 u = u, any probabilities we can express using the Q function we can alsoexpress using the  function. There is no hard and fast rule for whether to use the  function or theQ function, but typically we use Qu for values of u that are larger than three or four, and ufor smaller positive values of u. When we deal with probabilities that are close to one it is usuallymore convenient to represent them as one minus something, for example writing 1  8.5  106instead of 0.9999915. The  and Q functions are available on many programable calculators andon Internet websites.4 Some numerical values of these functions are given in Tables 6.1 and 6.2, inthe appendix.Let  be any number and  > 0. If X is a standard Gaussian random variable, and Y = X +,then Y is a N , 2 random variable. Indeed,fX u =12expcid:18cid:19, u22so by the scaling rule 3.5,fY v ==cid:18 v  cid:19cid:18 v  2exp22fX112cid:19,so fY is indeed the N , 2 pdf. Graphically, this means that the N , 2 pdf can be obtainedfrom the standard normal pdf by stretching it horizontally by a factor , shrinking it vertically bya factor , and sliding it over by .Working in the other direction, if Y has the N , 2 distribution, then the standardized versionof Y , namely X = Y  , is a standard normal random variable. Graphically, this means that thestandard normal pdf can be obtained from the N , 2 pdf by sliding it over by  so it becomescentered at zero, shrinking it by a factor  horizo
