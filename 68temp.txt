So by the denition of pdfs i.e. Denition 3.2.1, the quantity in squarebrackets is the pdf of X :Similarly,fX u =fY v =fX,Y u, vdv.fX,Y u, vdu.4.74.8cid:90 cid:90 cid:90 cid:90 cid:26cid:90 cid:90 4.3. JOINT PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS167The pdfs fX and fY are called the marginal pdfs of the joint distribution of X and Y. Since X istrivially a function of X and Y , the mean of X can be computed directly from the joint pdf byLOTUS:EX =ufX,Y u, vdudv.cid:27cid:90 If the integration over v is performed rst it yields the denition of EX in terms of the marginalpdf, fX :EX =ufX,Y u, vdvdu =ufX udu.The conditional pdf of Y given X, denoted by fY |X v|uo, is undened if fX uo = 0. It isdened for uo such that fX uo > 0 byfY |X v|uo =fX,Y uo, vfX uo  < v < +.4.9Graphically, the connection between fX,Y and fY |X v|uo for uo xed, is quite simple. For uoxed, the right hand side of 4.9 depends on v in only one place; the denominator, fX uo, isjust a constant. So fY |X v|uo as a function of v is proportional to fX,Y uo, v, and the graph offX,Y uo, v with respect to v is obtained by slicing through the graph of the joint pdf along the lineu  uo in the u  v plane. The choice of the constant fX uo in the denominator in 4.9 makesfY |X v|uo, as a function of v for uo xed, itself a pdf. Indeed, it is nonnegative, andcid:90 cid:90 fY |X v|uodv =fX,Y uo, vfX uodv =1fX uofX,Y uo, vdv =fX uofX uo= 1.In practice, given a value uo for X, we think of fY |X v|uo as a new pdf for Y , based on ourchange of view due to observing the event X = uo. There is a bit of diculty in this interpretation,because PX = uo = 0 for any uo. But if the joint density function is suciently regular, thenthe conditional density is a limit of conditional probabilities of events:cid:18Y cid:0v  cid:1cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12X cid:0uo  cid:1cid:19.2 , v + 22 , uo + 2fY |X v|uo = lim0PAlso, the denition of conditional pdf has the intuitive property that fX,Y u, v = fY |X v|ufX u.So 4.8 yields a version of the law of total probability for the pdf of Y :cid:90 cid:90 fY v =fY |X v|ufX udu.4.10The expectation computed using the conditional pdf is called the conditional expectation orconditional mean of Y given X = u, written asEY |X = u =cid:90 vfY |X v|udv.168CHAPTER 4. JOINTLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM VARIABLESSo EY |X = u is a deterministic function of u. To emphasize that fact, we could denote it by g,so gu = EY |X = u for all u. If that function is applied to the random variable X, the resultis a random variable denoted by EY |X = gX.In summary, EY |X = u is a deterministicfunction of u. In contrast, EY |X is obtained by applying that same deterministic function, butto X instead of to u, so EY |X is a random variable. Conditional expectations play an importantrole in estimation of one random variable from another, as shown in Section 4.9.Example 4.3.1 Suppose X and Y have the joint pdf:cid:26 c1  u  v0fX,Y u, v =if u  0, v  0, u + v  1else,4.11where c is a constant to be determined. The pdf and its support are shown in Figure 4.4. Find theFigure 4.4: The pdf 4.11 and its support.constant c, the marginal pdf of X, and the conditional pdf of Y given X.Solution: We rst derive c by a geometric argument. The value of c is such that the integral offX,Y over the plane is one. Equivalently, the volume of the region between the u  v plane and thegraph of fX,Y should be one. That region is similar to a cone or pyramid, in that it is the spacebetween a two-dimensional base and a vertex. The volume of such regions is one third the area ofthe base times the height of the vertex above the plane of the base. The base in this case is thesupport of fX,Y , which is a triangular region with area 1/2. The height is c. So the volume is c/6,which should be one, so c = 6.The marginal pdf of X is given bycid:90 cid:40 cid:82 1uo0fX uo ==fX,Y uo, vdvc1  uo  vdv = c1uo2200  uo  1otherwise.Note that if we hadnt already found that c = 1/6, we could nd c using the expression for fX justfound, because fX must integrate to one.

Thus, fX has support 0, 1 with fX uo = 31  uo2 for 0  uo  1.The conditional density fY |X v|uo is dened only if uo is in the support of fX : 0  uo < 1.For such uo,fY |X v|uo =cid:40 21uov1uo200  v  1  uoelse.That is, the conditional pdf of Y given X = uo has a triangular shape, over the interval 0, 1uo, asshown in Figure 4.5.
