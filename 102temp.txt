he event that the circuit is faulty, and A be the event that the output iscorrect for all three test patterns. If F is true, then A is true if and only if the pattern1100 is not among the three randomly selected test patterns, so P A|F  = 1316 . One wayto see that P A|F  = 1316 is to suppose the three test patterns are selected by generatinga random permutation of all 16 patterns, and then using the rst three patterns inthe permutation. The probability 1100 is in one of the rst three positions of thepermutation, and hence the probability it is included in the set of three test patterns,is 316 . A more tedious but straightforward way to prove thatP A|F  = 1316 is to consider the test patterns to be selected one at a time. The rst testpattern is not equal to 1100 with probability 1516 . Given that the rst test pattern is not16 . Therefore, P A|F  = 13equal to 1100, the second test pattern is not equal to 1100 with probability 1415 . Given thatthe rst two test patterns are not equal to 1100, the third test pattern is not equal to 110014 . Multiplying these three probabilities gives P A|F  = 13with probability 1316 . Thus, byBayes rule, P F|A = P F,AP A|F P F P A|F P F +P A|F cP F c =29 = 0.4483.P A == 1321316 12 +1 121316 12.46. Distribution of capacity of an s  t ow networkThe possible values of Y are 0, 8, 10. The event Y = 10 is true if and only if links 1, 3, and4 all do not fail, so pY 10 = 1 p3. The event Y > 0 is true if and only if at least one linkdoes not fail in each of the three stages, so pY 0 = 1 PY > 0 = 1 1 p21 p1 p2.Finally, pY 8 = PY > 0 pY 10 = 1 p21 p1 p2 1 p3. Writing these answersas polynomials in p yields:pY 0 = p + 2p2  2p3  p4 + p5pY 8 = 2p  5p2 + 3p3 + p4  p5pY 10 = 1  3p + 3p2  p3For p = 0.5 we have pY 0, pY 8, pY 10 = 23/32, 5/32, 4/32.Cumulative distribution functions CDFs Section 3.13.2. Using a CDF IIa PX = 5 is equal to the size of the jump of FX at 5, which is 0.25.b There is no jump of FX at zero, so PX = 0 = 0.c P|X|  5 = P5  X  5 = PX  5  PX < 5 = FX 5  FX 5 =1  0.25 = 0.75. Here, FX 5 represents the left-hand limit of FX at the point -5.Another way to think about it is that P|X|  5 = PX = 5 + PX = 5 + P5 <X < 5 = 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.75.d PX 2  4 = P2  X  2 = FX 2  FX 2 = 0.6  0.5 = 0.1.Continuous-type random variables, uniform and exponentialdistributions, and Poisson processes Sections 3.2-3.53.4.

One is to perform the integration ofthe pdf following the denition. Other ways are to argue geometrically, using the fact6.6. SOLUTIONS TO EVEN NUMBERED PROBLEMS261that the area of a triangle is one half the base times height. For example, if c  1, 2,then F c is one minus the area of the triangle formed by the pdf over the interval c, 2.That triangle has base and height 2  c, so its area is 1/22  c2, and the CDF is1  1/22  c2. A dierent way for c  1, 2 is to add the area of the left half of thepdf which is 1/2 to the area of the trapezoid formed by the pdf over the interval 1, c.This gives F c = 1/2 + c  11 + 2  c/2, because the area of a trapezoid is thebase times the average height.3.6. Selecting pdf parameters to match a mean and CDFThe density is symmetric about a so the mean is a. Therefore a = X = 2.In order for fX to be a valid pdf, it must integrate to one. The region under fX consistsof a rectangle of area 2b1 and two triangles of area c1/2 each, so its total area is 2b + c;therefore, 2b + c = 1.By inspection of the gure, FX a b is the area of the rst triangle, so FX a b = c2 . By theformula given for FX , FX a  b = 5c26 , or c = 0.6.  ALTERNATIVELY, taking3 u  a  b  c in thethe derivative of the expression given form FX shows that fX u = 5interval a  b  c, a  b. Setting fX a  b = 1 givens 5c3 = 1 or c = 0.6. ALTERNATIVELY,3 over the interval a b c, a b. By thetaking the derivative of FX twice yields F cid:48cid:483 = 1picture, the slope of fX over the interval is 1c or c = 0.6. There are other ways toderive c = 0.6; they all involve comparing the picture of fX over the interval a  b  c, a  bto the formula given for FX . Since 2b + c = 1, b = 0.2.X = 5c . So 5X = fcid:486 . So c2 = 5c23.8.

Uniform and exponential distribution IIa Let B be the event the radio comes from the rst batch and let L be the lifetime of theradio. Lets calculate PL  c for any constant c  0, because it will be needed forseveral values of c. By the law of total probability,PL  c = P L  c|BP B + P L  c|BcP Bc.Since L is uniformly distributed over the interval 0, 2 if B is true,ci
