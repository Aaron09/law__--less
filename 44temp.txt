The function in b is not nondecreasing, and it does not converge to zero at . The functionin d does not converge to zero at . The function in e is not right continuous.The vast majority of random variables described in applications are one of two types, to bedescribed next.

The probabilitymass function pmf of a discrete-type random variable X, denoted pX u, is dened by pX u =PX = u. Typically the pmf of a discrete random variable is much more useful than the CDF.However, the pmf and CDF of a discrete-type random variable are related by pX u = cid:52FX uand conversely,cid:88u:ucFX c =pX u,3.1where the sum in 3.1 is taken only over u such that pX u cid:54= 0. If X is a discrete-type randomvariable with only nitely many mass points in any nite interval, then FX is a piecewise constantfunction.A random variable X is a continuous-type random variable if the CDF is the integral of afunction:FX c =cid:90 cfX udu.The function fX is called the probability density function. Continuous-type random variables arethe subject of the next section.The relationship among CDFs, pmfs, and pdfs is summarized in Figure 3.5. Any random vari-Figure 3.5: Ways to describe distributions of random variablesable X on an arbitrary probability space has a CDF FX . The D in CDF stands for distribution.But in common usage, the response to the question What is the distribution of X? is answeredby giving one or more of FX , pX , or fX , or possibly a transform of one of these, whichever ismost convenient. Any of these have equivalent information and specify the probability of all eventsinvolving X alone, but in a given application often one way to express the distribution is moreuseful than another.usefulpmfpdfrandom variablesfor discrete!typefor continuous!typealways exists  random variablesOften moreCDFFXpXfX100CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLES3.2 Continuous-type random variablesDenition 3.2.1 A random variable X is a continuous-type random variable if there is a functionfX , called the probability density function pdf  of X, such thatcid:90 cFX c =fX udu,for all c  R. The support of a pdf fX is the set of u such that fX u > 0.It follows by the fundamental theorem of calculus that if X is a continuous-type random variableand if the pdf fX is continuous, then the pdf is the derivative of the CDF: fX = F cid:48X . In particular, ifX is a continuous-type random variable with a continuous pdf, FX is dierentiable, and therefore FXis a continuous function.1 That is, there are no jumps in FX , so for any constant v, PX = v = 0.It may seem strange at rst that PX = v = 0 for all numbers v, because if we add theseprobabilities up over all v, we get zero. It would seem like X cant take on any real value. But re-member that there are uncountably many real numbers, and the axiom that probability is additive,Axiom P.2, only holds for countably innite sums.cid:90 bIf a < b thenPa < X  b = FX b  FX a =fX udu.Since PX = a = PX = b = 0, it follows more generally that:aPa < X  b = Pa < X < b = Pa  X  b = Pa  X < b =cid:90 bafX udu.So when we work with continuous-type random variables, we dont have to be precise about whetherthe endpoints of intervals are included when calculating probabilities.It follows that the integral of fX over every interval a, b is greater than or equal to zero, sofX must be a nonnegative function. Also,1 = lima limb+ FX b  FX a =cid:90 fX udu.Therefore, fX integrates to one. In most applications, the density functions fX are continuous, orpiecewise continuous.Although PX = u = 0 for any real value of u, there is still a fairly direct interpretation of fXinvolving probabi
