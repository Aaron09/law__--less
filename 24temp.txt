ory, but it illustrates the essenceof the Markov inequality. If asked to place 200 balls within 100 buckets to maximize the numberof buckets with ve or more balls, you would naturally put ve balls in the rst bucket, ve in thesecond bucket, and so forth, until you ran out of balls. In that way, youd have 40 buckets with veor more balls; that is the maximum possible; if there were 41 buckets with ve or more balls thenthere would have to be at least 205 balls. This solution can also be approached using the Markov2.9. MARKOV AND CHEBYCHEV INEQUALITIES AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS51100cid:88inequality as follows. Suppose the balls are distributed among the buckets in some particular way.The probability experiment is to select one of the buckets at random, with all buckets having equalprobability. Let Y denote the number of balls in the randomly selected bucket. Then Y is anonnegative random variable withEY  =0.01number of balls in ith bucket = 0.01200 = 2,i=1so by Markovs inequality, PY  5  25 = 0.4. That is, the fraction of buckets with ve or moreballs is less than or equal to 0.4. Equality is achieved if and only if the only possible values of Yare zero and ve, that is, if and only if each bucket is either empty or has exactly ve balls.Second, the Chebychev inequality states that if X is a random variable with nite mean  andvariance 2, then for any d > 0,2.12The Chebychev inequality follows by applying the Markov inequality with Y = |X|2 and c = d2.A slightly dierent way to write the Chebychev inequality is to let d = a, for any constant a > 0,to getP|X  |  d  2d2 .Pcid:12cid:12X  |  a  1a2 .2.13In words, this form of the Chebychev inequality states that the probability that a random variablediers from its mean by a or more standard deviations is less than or equal to 1a2 .Condence Intervals The Chebychev inequality can be used to provide condence intervals forestimators. Condence intervals are often given when some percentages are estimated based onsamples from a large population. For example, an opinion poll report might state that, based on asurvey of some voters, 64% favor a certain proposal, with polling accuracy 5%. In this case, wewould call 59%, 69% the condence interval. Also, although it is not always made explicit, there isusually a level of condence associated with the condence interval. For example, a 95% condencein a condence interval means that, from the perspective of someone before the data is observed,the probability the random condence interval contains the xed, true percentage is at least 95%.It does not mean, from the perspective of someone who knows the value of the condence intervalcomputed from observed data, that the probability the true parameter is in the interval is at least95%.In practice, the true fraction of voters that favor a certain proposition would be a given number,say p. In order to estimate p we could select n voters at random, where n is much smaller than thetotal population of voters. For example, a given poll might survey n = 200 voters to estimate thefraction of voters, within a population of several thousand voters, that favor a certain proposition.n , where X denotes the number of the n sampledvoters who favor the proposition. We shall discuss how a condence interval with a given level ofcondence could be determined for this situation. Assuming the population is much larger than n,The resulting estimate of p would be cid:98p = X52CHAPTER 2.

It is treated as a constant, even though we dontcid:113 p1pknow its value. The variablecid:98p is random, and therefore the intervalthe probability experiment is observed, not the parameter p. Likewise, cid:98p is sometimes called ais also random. In fact, such an interval is sometimes called an interval estimator to emphasizethat it is the interval itself that is random from the perspective of someone before the data forcid:113 p1p,cid:98p + apoint estimator. For example, if a = 5, then, before we start taking the poll, we would have 96%condence that p will be in this random interval. This interval is not quite suitable for use asa condence interval, because it depends on the unknown parameter p, so we wouldnt know theinterval. However, p1 p  0.25 for any p  0, 1, so if we replace p1 p by 0.25 in dening thecondence interval, it makes the condence interval larger, and therefore it can only i
