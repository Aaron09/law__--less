SAMPLE SPACES WITH INFINITE CARDINALITY15In the terminology of the game of poker, a FULL HOUSE is the event that three of the cards allhave the same number, and the other two cards both have some other number. For example, theoutcome 1D, 1H, 1S, 2H, 2S is an element of FULL HOUSE, because three of the cards have thenumber 1 and the other two cards both have the number 2. STRAIGHT is the event that thenumbers on the ve cards can be arranged to form ve consecutive integers, or that the numberscan be arranged to get the sequence 10,11,12,13,1 because, by tradition, the 1 card, or ace, canact as either the highest or lowest number. For example, the outcome 3D, 4H, 5H, 6S, 7D is anelement of STRAIGHT.

Forexample, an experiment could be to randomly select a number from the interval 0, 1, and thereare innitely many numbers in the interval 0, 1. This section discusses innite sets in general, andincludes examples of sample spaces with innitely many elements. The section highlights someimplications of Axiom P.2.The previous two sections discuss how to nd the cardinality of some nite sets. What aboutthe cardinality of innite sets? Do all innite sets have the same number of elements? In a16CHAPTER 1. FOUNDATIONSstrong sense, no. The smallest sort of innite set is called a countably innite set, or a set withcountably innite cardinality, which means that all the elements of the set can be placed in a list.Some examples of countably innite sets are the set of nonnegative integers Z+ = 0, 1, 2, . . .,the set of all integers Z = 0, 1,1, 2,2, 3,3, . . ., and the set of nonnegative rational numbers:Q+ =  ij : i  1, j  1, integers. Figure 1.3 shows a two dimensional array that contains everypositive rational number at least once. The zig-zag path in Figure 1.3 shows how all the elementscan be placed on an innite list.Figure 1.3: An innite list containing all positive rational numbersSo there are many countably innite sets, but the set of real numbers is denitely larger, asshown by the following proposition.Proposition 1.5.1 The set of real numbers is not countable.Proof. We will prove that not even the set of numbers in the interval 0, 1 is countable. Itis enough to show that for any list of numbers from the interval 0, 1, there is at least one othernumber in 0, 1 that is not on the list. So, let a1, a2, . . . be a list of numbers from the interval 0, 1.Consider the decimal expansions of these numbers. For example, it might appear as follows:a1 = 0.3439098a2 = 0.2439465a3 = 0.9493554a4 = 0.3343876a5 = 0.9495249 .For each k, the kth digit after the decimal point of ak is underlined in this list. Let a be thenumber in 0, 1 such that its kth digit is two larger modulo 10 than the kth digit of ak. For theexample shown, a = 0.56154 . For any k  1, a cid:54= ak because the kth digit of a diers by atleast two from the kth digit of ak. In particular, a and ak cant be dierent representations of thesame number, like 0.1999 and 0.200 . So a is not in the list. So no list of numbers from theinterval 0, 1 can contain all of the numbers from 0, 1.From an engineering perspective, if a set is countably innite, it means that any element inthe set can be referenced by a nite string of bits.

SAMPLE SPACES WITH INFINITE CARDINALITY17can be dierent nite lengths. This is called a variable length encoding of the set. It is enough torepresent the index of the element in the list. For example, if  is the twenty sixth element of thelist, then the representation of  would be the binary expansion of 26, or 11010. Proposition 1.5.1means that it is impossible to index the set of real numbers by variable length binary strings ofnite length45,54,6315,24,42,5113,26,31,35,11,22,44,5546,53,62,641.5.
