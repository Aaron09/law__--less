Then the uniform distribution overS is the one with the following pdf:1area of Sif u, v  S0else.fX,Y u, v =If A is a subset of the plane, thenPX, Y   A =area of A  Sarea of S.4.12The support of the uniform pdf over S is simply S itself. The next two examples concern uniformdistributions over two dierent subsets of R2.Example 4.3.2 Suppose X, Y  is uniformly distributed over the unit circle. That is, take S =u, v : u2 + v2 = 1. Since the area of S is , the joint pdf is given bycid:26 10fX,Y u, v =if u2 + v2  1else.The pdf and its support are pictured in Figure 4.6.
