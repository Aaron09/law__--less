This is the same result one would get by the following argument, based on the lawof large numbers. We expect, during the year, the stock to increase by one percent about 365*0.5times, and to decrease by one percent about 365*0.1 times. That leads to a year end value of1.01182.50.9936.5 = 4.26.216CHAPTER 4. JOINTLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM VARIABLES4.11 Joint Gaussian distributionRecall that Gaussian distributions often arise in practice; this fact is explained by the CLT. TheCLT can be extended to two, or even more, correlated random variables. For example, supposeU1, V1, U2, V2, are independent, identically distributed pairs of random variables. For exam-ple, Ui might be the height, and Vi the weight, of the ith student to enroll at a university. Supposefor convenience that they have mean zero. Then as n  , the pairhas alimiting bivariate distribution, where bivariate means the limit distribution is a joint distributionof two random variables. Suppose X and Y have such a limit distribution. Then X and Y musteach be Gaussian random variables, by the CLT. But also for any constants a and b, aX + bYmust be Gaussian, because aX + bY has the limiting distribution of aU1+bV1++aUn+bVn, whichis Gaussian by the CLT. This observation motivates the following denition:cid:16 U1++Un, V1++Vncid:17nnnDenition 4.11.1 Random variables X and Y are said to be jointly Gaussian if every linearcombination aX + bY is a Gaussian random variable.For the purposes of this denition, aconstant is considered to be a Gaussian random variable with variance zero.Being jointly Gaussian includes the case that X and Y are each Gaussian and linearly related:X = aY + b for some a, b or Y = aX + b for some a, b. In these cases, X and Y do not have ajoint pdf. Aside from those two degenerate cases, a pair of jointly Gaussian random variables hasa bivariate normal or Gaussian pdf, given by3fX,Y u, v =cid:1121  212X Yexpcid:16 uXcid:172X+cid:16 vYYcid:172  2cid:16 uXcid:17cid:16 vYcid:17XY21  2 ,4.40where the ve parameters X , Y , X , Y ,  satisfy X > 0, Y > 0 and 1 <  < 1. As shownbelow, X and Y are the means of X and Y , respectively, X and Y are the standard deviations,respectively, and  is the correlation coecient. We shall describe some properties of the bivariatenormal pdf in the remainder of this section.the form: fX,Y u, v = C expP u, v, where P is a second order polynomial of two variables:There is a simple way to recognize whether a pdf is a bivariate normal. Namely, such a pdf hasP u, v = au2 + buv + cv2 + du + ev + f.The constant C is selected so that the pdf integrates to one. Such a constant exists if and only ifP u, v  + as |u| + |v|  +, which requires a > 0, c > 0 and b2  4ac < 0. Without loss ofgenerality, we can take f = 0, because it can be incorporated into the constant C. Thus, the set ofbivariate normal pdfs can be parameterized by the ve parameters: a, b, c, d, e.3A proof can be given in the Fourier transform domain.4.11.

Their joint pdf is theproduct of their individual pdfs: e 222 e 222 =e 2+222.fW,Z,  =This joint pdf is called the standard bivariate normal pdf, and it is the special case of the generalbivariate normal pdf obtained by setting the means to zero, the standard deviations to one, andthe correlation coecient to zero.
