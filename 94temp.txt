Onthe other hand, it sometimes makes sense to postulate or estimate joint moments, without ex-plicitly estimating distributions. For jointly Gaussian random variables, the two approaches areequivalent. That is, working with the moments is equivalent to working with the distributionsthemselves. Independence, which in general is stronger than being uncorrelated, is equivalent tobeing uncorrelated for the case of jointly Gaussian random variables.Chapter 6Appendix6.1 Some notationThe following notational conventions are used in these notes.Ac = complement of AAB = A  BA  B  any element of A is also an element of BA  B = ABccid:26 1 if x  AIAx =a, b = x : a < x < ba, b = x : a  x < b0elsea, b = x : a < x  ba, b = x : a  x  bZ  set of integersZ+  set of nonnegative integersR  set of real numbersR+  set of nonnegative real numberscid:98tcid:99 = greatest integer n such that n  tcid:100tcid:101 = least integer n such that n  tThe little oh notation for small numbers is sometimes used: oh represents a quantity suchthat limh0ohh = 0.
