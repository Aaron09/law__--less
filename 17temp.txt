ition of independence is symmetric in A and B. Therefore,A is independent of B if and only if B is independent of A. Another commonly used terminology forthese two equivalent relations is to say that A and B are mutually independent. Here, mutuallymeans that independence is a property of the two events. It does not make sense to say that asingle event A is independent, without reference to some other event.If the experiment underlying the probability space ,F, P  involves multiple physically sep-arated parts, then it is intuitively reasonable that an event involving one part of the experimentshould be independent of another event that involves some other part of the experiment that isphysically separated from the rst. For example, when an experiment involves the rolls of two fairdice, it is implicitly assumed that the rolls of the two dice are physically independent, and an eventA concerning the number showing on the rst die would be physically independent of any eventconcerning the number showing on the second die. So, often in formulating a model, it is assumedthat if A and B are physically independent, then they should be independent under the probabilitymodel ,F, P .The condition for A to be independent of B, namely P AB = P AP B is just a singleequation that can be true even if A and B are not physically independent.Example 2.4.2 Consider a probability experiment related to the experiment discussed in Section1.3, in which a fair coin is ipped and a die is rolled, with N denoting the side showing on thecoin and X denoting the number showing on the die. We should expect the event N = Hto be independent of the event X = 6, because they are physically independent events. Thisindependence holds, assuming all twelve outcomes in  are equally likely, because then PN =2.4.INDEPENDENCE AND THE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION35H = 6/12, PX = 6 = 2/12, and PN = H, X = 6 = 1/12, so PN = H, X = 6 = PN =HPX = 6. More generally, any event involving only X is independent of any event involvingonly N.Example 2.4.3 Suppose the probability experiment is to roll a single die. Let A be the eventthat the outcome is even, and let B be the event that the outcome is a multiple of three. Sincethese events both involve the outcome of a single role of a die, we would not consider them tobe physically independent. However, A = 2, 4, 6, B = 3, 6, and AB = 6. So P A = 12 ,P B = 16 . Therefore, P AB = P AP B, which means that A and B aremutually independent. This is a simple example showing that events can be mutually independent,even if they are not physically independent.3 and P AB = 1Here is a nal note about independence of two events. Suppose A is independent of B. ThenP AcB = P B  P AB = 1  P AP B = P AcP B,so Ac is independent of B. Similarly, A is independent of Bc, and therefore, by the same reasoning,Ac is independent of Bc. In summary, the following four conditions are equivalent: A is independentof B, Ac is independent of B, A is independent of Bc, Ac is independent of Bc.Let us now consider independence conditions for three events. The following denition simplyrequires any one of the events to be independent of any one of the other events.Denition 2.4.4 Events A, B, and C are pairwise independent if P AB = P AP B, P AC =P AP C and P BC = P BP C.Example 2.4.5 Suppose two fair coins are ipped, so  = HH, HT, T H, T T, and the fouroutcomes in  are equally likely. LetA = HH, HT =rst coin shows heads,B = HH, T H =second coin shows heads,C = HH, T T =both coins show heads or both coins show tails.It is easy to check that A, B, and C are pairwise independent. Indeed, P A = P B = P C = 0.5and P AB = P AC = P BC = 0.25. We would consider A to be physically independent of Bas well, because they involve ips of dierent coins. Note that P A|BC = 1 cid:54= P A. That is,knowing that both B and C are true aects the probability that A is true. So A is not independentof BC.Example 2.4.5 illustrates that pairwise independence of events does not imply that any oneIn order to have suchof the events is independent of the intersection of the other two events.independence, a stronger condition is used to dene independence of three events:36CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESDenition 2.4.6 Events A, B, and C are independent if they are pairwise independent and ifP ABC = P AP BP C.Suppose A, B, C are independent. Then A or Ac is independent of any event that can bemade from B and C by set operations. For example, A is independent of BC because P ABC =P ABC = P AP BP C = P AP BC. For a somewhat more complicated example, heres aproof that A is independent of B  C :P AB  C = P AB + P AC  P ABC= P AP B + P C  P BP C= P AP B  C.If the three events A, B, and C have to do with three physically separated parts of a probabilityexperiment, then we would expect them to be independent. But three events could happen to beindependent even if they are not physically separated. The denition of independence for threeevents involves four equalitiesone for each pairwiseition of independence is symmetric in A and B.
