distribution of a random variablethat is is a function, gX, of another random variable. If gX is a discrete random variable, Step 1is to scope the problem, and Step 2 is to nd the pmf of gX. If gX is a continuous-type randomvariable, Step 1 is to scope the problem, Step 2 is to nd the CDF, and Step 3 is to dierentiate theCDF to nd the pdf. The same procedures work to nd the pmf or pdf of a random variable thatis a function of two random variables, having the form gX, Y . An important function of X, Y is the sum, X + Y. Weve seen by linearity of expectation, 4.5, that EX + Y  = EX + EY .This section focuses on determining the distribution of the sum, X + Y, under various assumptionson the joint distribution of X and Y.4.5.1 Sums of integer-valued random variablesSuppose S = X + Y, where X and Y are integer-valued random variables. We shall derive the pmfof S in terms of the joint pmf of X and Y. For a xed value k, the possible ways to get S = k can1If the density did factor, then for 0 < u1 < u2 < 1 and 0 < v1 < v2 < 1 the following would have to hold:u1 + v1u2 + v2 = u1 + v2u2 + v1, or equivalently, u2  u1v2  v1 = 0, which is a contradiction.pSk = PX + Y = kPX = j, Y = k  jpX,Y j, k  j.==cid:88cid:88jjcid:88pSk =pX jpY k  j.4.164.174.5. DISTRIBUTION OF SUMS OF RANDOM VARIABLES179be indexed according to the value of X. That is, for S = k to happen, it must be that X = j andY = k  j for some value of j. Therefore, by the law of total probability,If X and Y are independent, then pX,Y j, k  j = pX jpY k  j, and 4.16 becomes:By the denition of the convolution operation , 4.17 is equivalent to:jpS = pX  pYif S = X + Y , where X, Y are independent.Example 4.5.1 Suppose X has the binomial distribution with parameters m and p, Y has thebinomial distribution with parameters n and p the same p as for X, and X and Y are independent.Describe the distribution of S = X + Y.Solution: This problem can be solved with a little thought and no calculation, as follows. Recallthat the distribution of X arises as the number of times heads shows if a coin with bias p is ippedm times. Then Y could be thought of as the number of times heads shows in n additional ips ofthe same coin. Thus, S = X + Y is the number of times heads shows in m + n ips of the coin. SoS has the binomial distribution with parameters m + n and p.That was easy, or, at least it didnt require tedious computation. Lets try doing it anotherway, and at the same time get practice using the convolution formula 4.17. Since the support ofX is 0, 1, . . . , m and the support of Y is 0, 1, . . . , n, the support of S is 0, 1, . . . , m + n. Soselect an integer k with 0  k  m + n.

Describethe distribution of S = X + Y.Solution: This problem can also be solved with a little thought and no calculation, as follows.Recall that the Poisson distribution is a limiting form of the binomial distribution with large nand small p. So let p be a very small positive number, and let m = 1/p and n = 2/p. Round tothe nearest integer if necessary so that m and n are integers. Then the distribution of X is wellapproximated by the binomial distribution with parameters m and p, and the distribution of Y iswell approximated by the binomial distribution with parameters n and p. So by Example 4.5.1, thedistribution of X + Y is well approximated by the binomial distribution with parameters m + n andp. But m + n is large and p is small, with the product m + np = mp + np = 1 + 2. Therefore,the distribution of X + Y is well approximated by the Poisson distribution with parameter 1 + 2.The approximations become better and better as p  0, so we conclude that X + Y has the Poissondistribution with parameter 1 + 2.X + Y is the set of nonnegative integers, so select an integer k  0.
