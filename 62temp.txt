Uniform and exponential distribution IIA factory produced two equal size batches of radios. All the radios look alike, but the lifetimeof a radio in the rst batch is uniformly distributed from zero to two years, while the lifetimeof a radio in the second batch is exponentially distributed with parameter  = 0.1years1.a Suppose Alicia bought a radio and after ve years it is still working.

Disk crashes modeled by a Poisson processSuppose disk crashes in a particular cloud computing center occur according to a Poissonprocess with mean rate  per hour, 24 hours per day, seven days a week i.e. 24/7.
