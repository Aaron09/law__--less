Note that the initial value of the pdf is given by fT 0 = , and the rate of decay of fT t asFigure 3.6: The pdfs for the exponential distributions with  = 1, 2, and 4.t increases is also .

Recall that for p close to zero, the geometricdistribution with parameter p has standard deviation nearly equal to the mean.2 , and in general, but induction on n, ET n = n!2 . The standard deviation of T is T = 12  12 = 1Example 3.4.1 Let T be an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter  = ln 2.Find the simplest expression possible for PT  t as a function of t for t  0, and ndP T  1|T  2.Solution.

Then PT > t = et. It follows thatP T > s + t|T > s ==PT > s + t, T > sPT > sPT > s + tPT > ses+tes== et = PT > t.That is, P T > s + t|T > s = PT > t. This is called the memoryless property for continuoustime.If T is the lifetime of a component installed in a system at time zero, the memorylessproperty of T has the following interpretation: Given that the component is still working after stime units, the probability it will continue to be working after t additional time units, is the sameas the probability a new component would still be working after t time units. As discussed later inSection 3.9, the memoryless property is equivalent to the failure rate being constant.Connection between exponential and geometric distributions As just noted, the expo-nential distribution has the memoryless property in continuous time. Recall from Section 2.5 thatthe geometric distribution has the memoryless property in discrete time. We shall further illus-trate the close connection between the exponential and geometric distributions by showing that theexponential distribution is the limit of scaled geometric distributions. In essence, the exponentialdistribution is the continuous time analog of the geometric distribution. When systems are modeledor simulated, it is useful to be able to approximate continuous variables by discrete ones, which areeasily represented in digital computers.Fix  > 0, which should be thought of as a failure rate, measured in inverse seconds. Let h > 0represent a small duration of time, measured in seconds. Imagine there is a clock that ticks once106CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESevery h time units. Thus, the clock ticks occur at times h, 2h, 3h, . . . . If we measure how long alightbulb lasts by the number of clock ticks, the smaller h is the larger the number of ticks. Wecan model the lifetime of a lightbulb as a discrete random variable if we assume the bulb can onlyfail at the times of the clock ticks. For small values of h this can give a good approximation to acontinuous type random variable. For small values of h, the probability p that the lightbulb failsbetween consecutive clock ticks should be proportionally small. Specically, set p = h. Consider alightbulb which is new at time zero, and at each clock tick it fails with probability p, given it hasntfailed earlier. Let Lh be the number of ticks until the lightbulb fails. Then Lh has the geometricdistribution with parameter p. The mean of Lh is given by ELh = 1h , which converges toinnity as h  0. Thats what happens when we measure the lifetime by the number of clock ticksusing a clock with a very high tick rate. Let Th be the amount of time until the lightbulb fails.Then Th = hLh. We shall show that the distribution of Th is close to the exponential distributionwith parameter  for small h.complementary CDF of Th can be found as follows. For any c  0,We have a handle on the distribution of Th because we know the distribution of Lh. Thep = 1PTh > c = PLhh > c= PLh > cid:98c/hcid:99= 1  hcid:98c/hcid:99,where the last equality follows from 2.8. Recall from 2.9 that cid:01  cid:1n  e as n  .Replacing n by 1/h implies that 1  h1/h  e as h  0, and therefore, 1  hc/h  ec ash  0. Also, the dierenc
