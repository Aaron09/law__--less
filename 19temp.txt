Thus, k is the value of k that maximizes pk; which is tosay that k is the mode of the pmf. For example, if n = 24 and p = 1/3, the pmf is maximized atk = 8, as seen in Figure 2.5.40A number m is called the median of the binomial distribution ifcid:80cid:80k:km pk  0.5.

Assumethat ties are not possible in each game, that each team wins a given game with probability onehalf, and the games are independent. The series ends once one of the teams has won four games,because after winning four games, even if all seven games were played, that team would have morewins than the other team, and hence it wins the series. Let Y denote the total number of gamesplayed. Find the pmf of Y.Solution. The possible values of Y are 4,5,6, or 7, so let 4  n  7. The event Y = n can beexpressed as the union of two events:Y = n = Y = n, A wins the series  Y = n, B wins the series.The events Y = n, A wins the series and Y = n, B wins the series are mutually exclusive, and,by symmetry, they have the same probability. Thus, pY n = 2PY = n, A wins the series. Next,notice that Y = n, A wins the series happens if and only if A wins three out of the rst n  1games, and A also wins the nth game. The number of games that team A wins out of the rst n 1games has the binomial distribution with parameters n  1 and p = 12 .

Here p is assumed to satisfy 0 < p  1.Thus, the outcome of each trial is one with probability p and zero with probability 1  p. Let Ldenote the number of trials conducted until the outcome of a trial is one. Let us nd the pmf ofL. Clearly the range of possible values of L is the set of positive integers. Also, L = 1 if and onlyif the outcome of the rst trial is one. Thus, pL1 = p. The event L = 2 happens if the outcomeof the rst trial is zero and the outcome of the second trial is one. By independence of the trials,it follows that pL2 = 1  pp. Similarly, the event L = 3 happens if the outcomes of the rsttwo trials are zero and the outcome of the third trial is one, so pL3 = 1  p1 pp = 1 p2p.By the same reasoning, for any k  1, the event L = k happens if the outcomes of the rst k  1trials are zeros and the outcome of the kth trial is one.
