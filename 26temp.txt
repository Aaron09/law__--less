Compared to nonsmokers,men who smoke are about 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer and women who smoke areabout 13 times more likely. a If you learn that a person is a woman who has been diagnosedwith lung cancer, and you know nothing else about the person, what is the probability she is asmoker? In your solution, use the CDC information that roughly 15% of all women smoke.b Suppose that in the USA, 15% of women are smokers, 18% of all adults are smokers, and halfof adults are women. What fraction of adult smokers in the USA are women?Solution:a Let c denote the fraction of nonsmoking women who get lung cancer over sometime period. Then 13c is the fraction of smoking women who get lung cancer over the same timeperiod. The total probability a typical woman gets lung cancer is the sum of the probability thewomen is a smoker and gets lung cancer plus the probability she is a nonsmoker and gets lungcancer, orPa woman gets lung cancer during the time period = 0.1513c + 0.85c.Thus, the conditional probability a women is a smoker given she got lung cancer is the rst of theterms over the sum:0.1513c0.1513c + 0.85c=0.15130.1513 + 0.85=1.952.80 67%.56CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESb The fraction of adults that smoke, namely 18%, is the average of the fraction of women thatsmoke, 15%, and the fraction of men that smoke.It follows that 21% of men smoke because15+212 = 18. Thus, the ratio of the number of women that smoke to the total number of adults thatsmoke is 15/15+21=15/36=5/12.Example 2.10.4 Consider two boxes as shown in Figure 2.9. Box 1 has three black and two whiteFigure 2.9: Initial state of boxes.balls, while Box 2 has two black and two white balls. Consider the following two step experiment.Step 1: Select a ball from Box 1, all ve having equal probability, and transfer it to Box 2.Step 2: Remove a ball from Box 2, with each of the ve balls having the same chance of beingremoved.Dene the following two events:W=the ball that is transferred is whiteB=the ball drawn from Box 2 is blackFind P W , P B, and P W|B?Solution: This problem is dicult to work out in ones head. But following the denition ofconditional probability, it is pretty simple. First, P W  = 25 because the ve possibilities in Step1 have equal probability, and W is consists of two of the ve possibilities. Second, by the law oftotal probability,P B = P B|W P W  + P B|W cP W c=25 25+35 35=1325.Box 2Box 12.10. THE LAW OF TOTAL PROBABILITY, AND BAYES FORMULA57Third,P W|B ===P W BP BP W P B|W P B=413.25  251325We just used Bayes formula, perhaps without even realizing it. For this example it is interestingto compare P W|B to P W . We might reason about the ordering as follows. Transferring a whiteball i.e. event W  makes removing a black ball in Step 2 i.e. event B less likely. So given thatB is true, we would expect the conditional probability of W to be smaller than the unconditionalprobability. That is indeed the case  413 < 25 .As weve seen, the law of total probability can be applied to calculate the probability of anevent, if there is a partition of the sample space. The law of total probability can also be used tocompute the mean of a random variable. The conditional mean of a discrete-type random variableX given an event A is dened the same way as the original unconditional mean, but using theconditional pmf:EX|A =uiP X = ui|A,and also the conditional version of LOTUS holds:EgX|A =guiP X = ui|A.cid:88cid:88iiJcid:88These equations were used implicitly in Section to derive the mean and variance of a geometricallydistributed random variable. The law of total probability extends from probabilities to conditionalexpectations as follows. If E1, . . . , EJ is a partition of the sample space, and X is a random variable,EX =EX|EjP Ej.j=1Example 2.10.5 Let 0 < p < 0.5. Suppose there are two biased coins. The rst coin shows headswith probability p and the second coin shows heads with probability q, where q = 1  p. Considerthe following two stage experiment. First, select one of the two coins at random, with each coinbeing selected with probability one half, and then ip the selected coin n times. Let X be thenumber of times heads shows. Compute the pmf, mean, and standard deviation of X.58CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESSolution: Let A be the event that the rst coin is selected.
