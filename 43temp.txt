DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESChapter 3Continuous-type random variablesChapter 2 dealt largely with discrete-type random variables, and nite collections of events. Muchof this chapter will involve continuous-type random variables, which have distributions describedby density functions, rather than by mass functions. The relationship of mass functions to densityfunctions is analogous to the relationship of peanuts to peanut butter. Whereas peanuts have massin discrete quantities, peanut butter has similar mass that can be spread out. A general, althoughsomewhat complicated, way to describe the distribution of any random variable is through the useof a cumulative distribution function, as described in the next section. Cumulative distributionfunctions form a natural bridge between discrete-type and continuous-type random variables.3.1 Cumulative distribution functionsLet a probability space ,F, P  be given. Recall that in Chapter 2 we dened a random variableto be a function X from  to the real line R. To be on mathematically rm ground, randomvariables are also required to have the property that sets of the form  : X  c should beeventsmeaning that they should be in F. Since a probability measure P assigns a probability toevery event, every random variable X has a cumulative distribution function CDF, denoted byFX . It is the function, with domain the real line R, dened byFX c = P : X  c= PX  c for short.Example 3.1.1 Let X denote the number showing for a roll of a fair die, so the pmf of X ispX i = 16 for integers i with 1  i  6. The CDF FX is shown in Figure 3.1.9596CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESFigure 3.1: CDF for the roll of a fair die.The notions of left limit and right limit are useful for discussing functions with jumps, suchas CDFs. Given a function F on the real line and a value x, the left limit of F at x, denoted byF x, is the limit of F y as y converges to x from the left. Similarly, the right limit of F at x,denoted by F x+, is the limit of F y as y converges to x from the right. That is,F x = limy  xy < xF yF x+ = limy  xy > xF y.Note that the CDF in Example 3.1.1 has six jumps of size 1/6. The jumps are located atthe six possible values of X, namely at the integers one through six, and the size of each ofthose jumps is 1/6, which is the probability assigned to each of the six possible values. Thevalue of the CDF exactly at a jump point is equal to the right limit at that point. For example,FX 1 = FX 1+ = 1/6 and FX 1 = 0. The size of the jump at any x can be written ascid:52FX x = FX x  FX x.The CDF of an arbitrary random variable X determines the probabilities of any events of theform X  A. Of course, the CDF of a random variable X determines PX  c for any realnumber cby denition it is just FX c. Similarly, PX  a, b = FX b FX a, whenever a < b.The next proposition explains how FX also determines probabilities of the form PX < c andPX = c.Proposition 3.1.2 Let X be a random variable and let c be any real number. Then PX < c =FX c and PX = c = cid:52FX c, where FX is the CDF of X.Proof. Fix c and let c1, c2, . . . be a sequence with c1 < c2 < . . . such that limj cj = c. LetG1 be the event G1 = X  c1 and for j  2 let Gj = cj1 < X  cj. Then for any n  1,X  cn = G1  G2    Gn. Also, X < c = G1  G2   and the events G1, G2, . . . aremutually exclusive. Therefore, by Axiom P.2,PX < c = P G1 + P G2 +  .1FX65432103.1. CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS97The sum of a series is, by denition, the limit of the sum of the rst n terms as n  . Therefore,PX < c = limnncid:88k=1P Gk = limn PG1  G2    Gn = limn PX  cn = limn FX cn.That is, PX < c = FX c. The second conclusion of the proposition follows directly from therst: PX = c = PX  c  PX < c = FX c  FX c = cid:52FX c.Example 3.1.3 Let X have the CDF shown in Figure 3.2.a Determine all values of u such that PX = u > 0. b Find PX  0. c Find PX < 0.Figure 3.2: An example of a CDF.a The CDF has only one jump, namely a jump of size 0.5 at u = 0. Thus, PX =Solution:0 = 0.5, and there are no values of u with u cid:54= 0 such that PX = u > 0.b PX  0 = FX 0 = 1. c PX < 0 = FX 0 = 0.5.Example 3.1.4 Let X have the CDhe s  t network shown.Suppose each link fails independently with probability p = 0.001.
