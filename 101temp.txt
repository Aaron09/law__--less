The ML rule is as follows: if X = i,decide H1 if i  1, or equivalently, if |i|  2.58, or equivalently, because i is integervalued, if |i|  3. Equivalently, 1 = 4,3, 3, 4 and 0 = 2,1, 0, 1, 2. Themeaning of 1 and 0 is that if X  1 we declare that H1 is true, and if X  0 wedeclare that H0 is true. p0i = 9i2b For the ML rule, pf alse alarm = P |X|  3|H0 = 4pmiss = P |X|  2|H1 = 22+12+02+12+22= 16 .609 , and60  2,c The MAP rule for X = i is to decide H1 if i  0or equivalently, if |i|  3.65, or equivalently, because i is integer valued, if |i|  4.Equivalently, 1 = 4, 4 and 0 = 3,2,1, 0, 1, 2, 3., or equivalently if 9i21d For the MAP rule, pf alse alarm = P |X|  4|H0 = 2= 2815 = 41pmiss = P |X|  3|H1 = 32+22+12+02+12+22+329 + 1error is pe = 0pf alse alarm + 1pmiss = 239 and60 = 7135  .0.3037.6027315 .

Field goal percentages  home vs. away20 so that 1  1a Using a =a2 = 0.95, the symmetric, two-sided condence interval forthe parameter p of a binomial distribution with known n and observed p has endpoints20kn . The given data yields the condence interval 0.290, 0.557 for ph and the2interval 0.309, 0.505 for pa. These intervals intersect; we say the data is not conclusive.n  b It can be said that if H0 were true, and if p denotes the common value of ph and pa,from a perspective before the experiment is conducted, the probability the condenceintervals will not intersect is less than or equal to the probability that at least one ofthe condence intervals will not contain p. The probability the condence interval for phwill not contain p is less than or equal to 5%, and the probability the condence intervalfor pa will not contain p is less than or equal to 5%. So the probability that at leastone of the two condence intervals will not contain p is less than or equal to 10%. Sotherefore, if H0 is true, before we know about the data, we would say the probabilitythe intervals do not intersect is less than or equal to 10%. Thus, if and when we observenonintersecting condence intervals, we can say either H0 is false, or we just observeddata with an unlikely extreme. Note that we cannot conclude that there is a 90% chancethat H1 is true.2.40. Hypothesis testing for independent geometrically distributed observationsa In Problem 2.26 weve seen that if p is the true parameter, then PL1, . . . , Ln =k1, . . . , kn = pn1  psn, where s = k1 +  + kn. The likelihood ratio for a givenobserved vector k1, . . . , kn is the ratio of this probability for p = 0.25 to the probabilityfor p = 0.5:k1, . . . , kn =0.25n0.75sn0.5n0.5sn =1.5s3n .The maximum likelihood decision rule declares in favor of H1 if k1, . . . , kn > 1, orequivalently if 1.5s  3n, or equivalently if s  n ln 3ln1.5 or if s  2.71n, and in favor ofH0 otherwise.Does this rule make sense? Equivalently, in terms of S = L1 +  + Ln, the rule is ton  2.71. This seems reasonable because if H1 is true, Sdeclare H1 is true, given S, if Snhas mean 4 and if H0 is true, Sn has mean 2, so the threshold 2.71 is close to halfwaybetween the two possible means.b The MAP rule can also be expressed as a likelihood ratio test, but for it, the threshold= 8. So the MAP rule decides H1 is true if 1.5s  83n, or, or s  5.13 + 2.71n. And declare H0 otherwise.to compare  to is 01equivalently, if s  ln 8+n ln 3ln1.5Reliability Section 2.122.42.

Fault detection in a Boolean circuita The correct output is one only for the three input sequences 1101, 1110, 1111. Withthe stuck at one fault present, the output is one only for the four input sequences 1100,1101, 1110, 1111. Thus, the output is incorrect only for the input sequence 1100. So theprobability of incorrect output due to the fault is 116 .b Let F be t
