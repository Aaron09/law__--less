distribution of a function of a random variab   Background 1 The appellant in this matter, Mr Trkulja, appeals against certain findings made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal AAT in a decision made on 26 July 2005.2 The appellant was made bankrupt on 4 September 2000 pursuant to a debtors petition.Mr Morton, who is not a party to these proceedings, was appointed trustee the trustee.The trustee, by a notice dated 24 January 2003, objected to the discharge of Mr Trkulja from bankruptcy pursuant to ss 149D1d , 149D 1n and 149 1b of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 Cth the Act.In a further notice dated 3 September 2003, the trustee objected to the discharge of Mr Trkulja from bankruptcy pursuant to ss 149D1c , 149D 1b and 149D 1f of the Act.The trustee also issued an income contribution assessment in relation to the appellant for the period 4 September 2000 to 3 September 2001.3 The second respondent in two decisions dated 16 September 2003 and 24 October 2003 the objection decisions, affirmed the decision of the trustee to file the notices of objection.However, having reviewed the income contribution assessment of the trustee, the second respondent issued a fresh income contribution assessment the income contribution decision.4 The AAT varied the objection decisions of the second respondent by setting aside those parts of the second respondents decisions which affirmed the grounds of objection to discharge under ss 149D1n , 149 1b and 149 1f.In all other respects, the second respondents decisions, including the income contribution decision, were affirmed by the AAT.5 The appellant, who was not legally represented, alleged that there were two errors of law by the AAT, namely:   a the AATs finding that the appellants income and contribution could be assessed under section 139ZDb of the Bankrupcy Act 1966 Cth based on an understanding that there was little or no change in the appellants circumstances between March and May 2000 and September 2001; and b that the Tribunal erred in law by incorrectly deciding that the appellants decision under section 149D1d of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 Cth was based on the hearsay evidence and was Without Legal Proof.    The first ground 6 The first ground of appeal concerns the AATs affirmation of the income contribution assessment decision of the second respondent.In his notice of appeal, the appellant made the following allegations in relation to this ground of appeal: a there was no evidence or other material to support the Tribunals decision that the income derived by the applicant between 4 September 2000 and 3 September 2001 was in the sum of $58,500.00; and b the Tribunal took into account the irrelevant consideration that the applicants stated income in a credit card application to Citibank dated 15 March 2000 was in the sum of $58,500.00. 7 The jurisdiction of this Court to review a decision of the AAT is confined by the terms of s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 Cth which confines an appeal to a question of law.In Neal v Secretary, Department of Transport 1980 29 ALR 350 at 354, Franki J stated that:  There is no appeal to this court on anything other than a question of law and therefore the court is not concerned with whether or not it would have come to the same conclusion as the Tribunal came to, but only with the question of whether the Tribunal erred in law. 8 In Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd 1993 43 FCR 280 at 286, the Full Court stated:  The limitation of the jurisdiction to the resolution of questions of law imposes a significant constraint upon the role of the Court in reviewing decisions of the Tribunal.The appealable error of law must arise on the facts found by the Tribunal or must vitiate the findings made or must have led the Tribunal to omit to make a finding it was legally required to make.A wrong finding of fact is not sufficient to demonstrate error of law.citation omitted 9 The errors of law alleged are that the AAT took into account irrelevant considerations and that there was no evidence upon which it could reach the conclusion that it did.Mason J in Peko-Wallsend Ltd 1986 HCA 40 ; 1996 162 CLR 24 at 40  Peko  explained the concept of relevant and irrelevant considerations as it applies to statutory decision-makers as follows:  In the context of judicial review on the ground of taking into account irrelevant considerations, this Court has held that, where a statute confers a discretion which in its terms is unconfined, the factors that may be taken in to account in the exercise of that discretion are similarly unconfined, except in so far as there may be some implied limitation on the factors to which the decision-maker may legitimately have regard.By analogy, where the ground of review is that a relevant consideration has not been taken into account and the discretion is unconfined by the terms of the statute, the court will not find that the decision-maker is bound to take a particular matter into account unless an implication that he is bound to do so i   Background 1 The appellant in this matter, Mr Trkulja, appeals against certain findings made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal AAT in a decision made on 26 July 2005.2 The appellant was made bankrupt on 4 September 2000 pursuant to a debtors petition.Mr Morton, who is not a party to these proceedings, was appointed trustee the trustee.The trustee, by a notice dated 24 January 2003, objected to the discharge of Mr Trkulja from bankruptcy pursuant to ss 149D1d , 149D 1n and 149 1b of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 Cth the Act.In a further notice dated 3 September 2003, the trustee objected to the discharge of Mr Trkulja from bankruptcy pursuant to ss 149D1c , 149D 1b and 149D 1f of the Act.The trustee also issued an income contribution assessment in relation to the appellant for the period 4 September 2000 to 3 September 2001.3 The second respondent in two decisions dated 16 September 2003 and 24 October 2003 the objection decisions, affirmed the decision of the trustee to file the notices of objection.However, having reviewed the income contribution assessment of the trustee, the second respondent issued a fresh income contribution assessment the income contribution decision.4 The AAT varied the objection decisions of the second respondent by setting aside those parts of the second respondents decisions which affirmed the grounds of objection to discharge under ss 149D1n , 149 1b and 149 1f.In all other respects, the second respondents decisions, including the income contribution decision, were affirmed by the AAT.5 The appellant, who was not legally represented, alleged that there were two errors of law by the AAT, namely:   a the AATs finding that the appellants income and contribution could be assessed under section 139ZDb of the Bankrupcy Act 1966 Cth based on an understanding that there was little or no change in the appellants circumstances between March and May 2000 and September 2001; and b that the Tribunal erred in law by incorrectly deciding that the appellants decision under section 149D1d of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 Cth was based on the hearsay evidence and was Without Legal Proof.
