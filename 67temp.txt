joint probability mass function joint pmf, denoted by pX,Y . It is dened by pX,Y u, v = PX =u, Y = v. If the numbers of possible values are small, the joint pmf can be easily described in atable. The joint pmf determines the probabilities of any events that can be expressed as conditionson X and Y. In particular, the pmfs of X and Y can be recovered from the joint pmf, using the lawof total probability, as follows. By denition, since X is a discrete-type random variable, there is anite or countably innite set of possible values of X; denote them by u1, u2, . . . . Similarly, thereis a nite or countably innite set of possible values of Y ; denote them by v1, v2, . . .The events of the form Y = vj are mutually exclusive, there are at most countably innitelymany such events, and together with the zero probability event F = Y cid:54 v1, v2, . . ., they164CHAPTER 4. JOINTLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM VARIABLESpartition . So for any u  R, the event X = u can be written as a union of mutually exclusiveevents:X = u =X = u, Y = vj  X = uF .cid:91jTherefore, by the additivity axiom of probability, Axiom P.2, and the fact P X = uF  = 0because P F  = 0:PX = u =PX = u, Y = vj4.24.3cid:88cid:88jjcid:88or equivalently,pX u =pX,Y u, vj.It is useful to consider 4.2, or equivalently, 4.3, to be an instance of the law of total probabilitybased on the partition F,Y = v1,Y = v2, Similarly,pY v =pX,Y ui, vIn this case, pX and pY are called the marginal pmfs of the joint pmf, pX,Y . The conditional pmfsare also determined by the joint pmf. For example, the conditional pmf of Y given X, pY |X v|uo,is dened for all uo such that pX uo > 0 by:ipY |X v|uo = P Y = v|X = uo =pX,Y uo, vpX uo.If pX uo = 0 then pY |X v|uo is undened.Example 4.2.1 Let X, Y  have the joint pmf given by Table 4.1.

JOINTLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM VARIABLESregions. If g is a function on the plane then the expectation of the random variable gX, Y  can becomputed using the law of the unconscious statistician LOTUS, just as for functions of a singlerandom variable:EgX, Y  =gu, vfX,Y u, vdudv.In turn, LOTUS implies linearity of expectation. For constants a, b, c, for example,cid:90 cid:90 cid:90 cid:90EaX + bY + ccid:90 cid:90cid:90 cid:90=au + bv + cfX,Y u, vdudv= aufX,Y u, vdudv + bvfX,Y u, vdudv + c= aEX + bEY  + c,cid:90 cid:90fX,Y u, vdudv4.5where all the integrals are over the entire real line.The following two properties are necessary and sucient for f to be a valid joint pdf:Property pdf.1: For any u, v  R2, f u, v  0.Property pdf.2: The integral of f over R2 is one, i.e. cid:82 cid:82  f u, vdudv = 1.Property pdf.1 has to be true for any pdf f because, by 4.4, the integral of f over any set isthe probability of an event, which must be nonnegative. Property pdf.2 has to be true for anypdf because the integral of f over R2 is, by 4.4, equal to PX, Y   R2, which is equal to onebecause, by denition, the pair X, Y  always takes a value in R2.Note that pdfs are dened over the entire plane R2, although often the pdfs are zero over largeregions. The support of a joint pdf is the set over which it is nonzero.The pdf of X alone or of Y alone can be obtained from the joint pdf, as follows. Given anyreal number uo, let Ruo be the region to the left of the vertical line u = uo in
