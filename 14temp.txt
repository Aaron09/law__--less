ree fair dice are rolled.Find the pmf and mean of Y.Solution The underlying sample space is  = i1i2i3 : 1  i1  6, 1  i2  6, 1  i3  6. Thereare six ways to choose i1, six ways to choose i2, and six ways to choose i3, so that || = 666 = 216.What are the possible values of Y ? Yes, Y takes values 1, 2, 3. The outcomes in  that give rise toeach possible value of Y are:Y = 1 = 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666Y = 2 = 112, 121, 211, 113, 131, 311, 114, 141, 411, , 665, 656, 566Y = 3 = i1i2i3   : i1, i2, i3 are distinct.Obviously, |Y = 1| = 6. The outcomes of Y = 2 are listed above in groups of three, such as112,121,211. There are thirty such groups of three, because there are six ways to choose whichnumber appears twice, and then ve ways to choose which number appears once, in the outcomesin a group. Therefore, |Y = 2| = 6  5  3 = 90. There are six choices for the rst numberof an outcome in Y = 3, then ve choices for the second, and then four choices for the third.So |Y = 3| = 6  5  4 = 120. To double check our work, we note that 6+90+120=216, asexpected. So, pY 1 = 636 . The mean of Y isNOT simply 1+2+3because the three possible values are not equally likely. The correct value is36 + 3  2036 + 2  15EY  = 1  136 , pY 2 = 9036  2.527.36 , and pY 3 = 120216 = 15216 = 20216 = 136 = 913The video gives a physical interpretation of the mean of a pmf, and describes how to buildand calibrate a nine volt calculator for calculating means.28CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESExample 2.2.4 Suppose X is a random variable taking values in 2,1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, each withprobability 18 . Let Y = X 2. Find EY .Solution. The pmf of X is given bypX u =cid:26 18 2  u  50 else.The denition of EY  involves the pmf of Y, so let us nd the pmf of Y. We rst think about thepossible values of Y which are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25, and then for each possible value u, ndpY u = PY = u. For example, for u = 1, pY 1 = PY = 1 = PX = 1 or X = 1 = 2/8.The complete list of nonzero values of pY is as follows:u pY u1/802/812/841/89161/81/8.25Therefore, EY  = 0  18 + 1  28 + 4  28 + 9  18 + 16  18 + 25  18 = 608 = 7.5.You may have noticed, without even thinking about it, that there is another way to computeEY  in Example 2.2.4. We can nd EY  without nding the pmf of Y. Instead of rst addingtogether some values of pX to nd pY and then summing over the possible values of Y, we can justdirectly sum over the possible values of X, yieldingEY  = 22  18+ 12  18+ 02  18+ 12  18+ 22  18+ 32  18+ 42  18+ 52  18.The general formula for the mean of a function, gX, of X, iscid:88EgX =guipX ui.2.2This formula is so natural it is called the law of the unconscious statistician LOTUS.iExample 2.2.5 Suppose two fair dice are rolled.
