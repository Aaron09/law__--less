An event is closely related to a binaryvariable; if a probability experiment is performed, then a particular event either occurs or does notoccur. A natural and useful generalization allows for more than two values:Denition 2.1.1 A random variable is a real-valued function on .Thus, if X is a random variable for a probability space ,F, P , if the probability experimentis performed, which means a value  is selected from , then the value of the random variable isX. The value X is called the realized value of X for outcome . A random variable can havemany possible values, and for a given subset of the real numbers, there is some probability thatthe value of the random variable is in the set. If A  R, then  : X  A is the event that thevalue of X is in A. For brevity, we usually write such an event as X  A and its probability asPX  A.A random variable is said to be discrete-type if there is a nite set u1, . . . , un or a countablyinnite set u1, u2, . . . such thatPX  u1, u2, . . . = 1.2.1The probability mass function pmf for a discrete-type random variable X, pX , is dened bypX u = PX = u. Note that 2.1 can be written as:cid:88ipX ui = 1.set A, PX  A =cid:80The pmf is sucient to determine the probability of any event determined by X, because for anyi:uiA pX ui. The support of a pmf pX is the set of u such that pX u > 0.Example 2.1.2 Let X be the number showing for a single roll of a fair die. Then pX i = 1integers i with 1  i  6. The support of the pmf is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.6 for2526CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESExample 2.1.3 Let S be the sum of the numbers showing on a pair of fair dice when they arerolled. Find the pmf of S.Solution: The underlying sample space is  = i, j : 1  i  6, 1  j  6, and it has 3636 . The smallest possible value of S is 2, and S =possible outcomes, each having probability 12 = 1, 1. That is, there is only one outcome resulting in S = 2, so pS2 = 136 . Similarly,S = 3 = 1, 2, 2, 1, so pS3 = 236 , andso forth. The pmf of S is shown in Fig. 2.1.36 . And S = 4 = 1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, so pS4 = 3Figure 2.1: The pmf of the sum of numbers showing for rolls of two fair dice.Example 2.1.4 Suppose two fair dice are rolled and that Y represents the maximum of the twonumbers showing. The same set of outcomes,  = i, j : 1  i  6, 1  j  6, can be used as inExample 2.1.3. For example, if a 3 shows on the rst die and a 5 shows on the second, then Y = 5.That is, Y 3, 5 = 5. In general, Y i, j = maxi, j for i, j  . Determine the pmf of Y.Solution: The possible values of Y are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. That is, the support of pY is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.There is only one outcome in  such that Y = 1. Specically, Y = 1 = 1, 1. Similarly,Y = 2 = 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1,Y = 3 = 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 1, 3, 2, and so forth.
