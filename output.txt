 It is important that students with other learning needs not be provided the text-to-speech or read aloud accommodations for the ELA reading passages. Only if this can be demonstrated should the text-to-speech or read aloud accommodation be considered for the student. Being a slow reader does not mean that the student should receive the text-to-speech or read aloud accommodation for the Smarter Balanced ELA reading assessment in grades 3-5. Readers may read aloud some or all of the content to students. This in itself is not an indication that text-to-speech or read aloud is an appropriate accommodation for the child.
