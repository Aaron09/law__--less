Linearization of a quadratic function of a random variableSuppose Y = gX where gu = 8u2 and X is uniformly distributed over 9.9, 10.1. Forexample, Y could be the total energy stored in a capacitor if X is the voltage across thecapacitor.a Using LOTUS and the fact VarY  = EY 2  EY 2, nd the mean and variance of Y.b Find and sketch the pdf of Y.c Note that X is always relatively close to 10. The rst order Taylor approximation yieldsthat gu  g10 + gcid:4810u  10 = 800 + 160u  10 for u near 10. Let Z =800+160X10. We expect Z to be a good approximation to Y . Identify the probabilitydistribution of Z.d Find the mean and variance of Z.e Your answers to a-d should show that Y and Z have nearly the same pdfs, means,and variances. To get another idea of how close Y and Z are, compute EY  Z2.Hint: Express Y  Z2 as a simple function of X and use LOTUS.3.34. Generation of a random variable with a given failure rate functionSuppose rt, t  0 is a positive, continuous function withcid:82 by X through the equation cid:82 Tponentially distributed random variable with parameter one. Let T be implicitly determined0 rsds = X. For example, if X is the amount of water in awell at time zero, and if water is scheduled to be drawn out with a time-varying ow ratert, then the well becomes dry at time T.0 rtdt = . Let X be an ex-cid:110X cid:82 tcid:111a Express the CDF of T in terms of the function r. Hint: For any t  0, the event T  tis equivalent to. Using the analogy above, it is because the well is dryat time t if and only if X is less than or equal to the amount of water scheduled to bedrawn out by time t.0 rsdsb Express the failure rate function h of T in terms of the function r.3.35. A simple hypothesis testing problem with continuous observationsOn the basis of a sensor output X, it is to be decided which hypothesis is true: H0 or H1.158CHAPTER 3.

COMPUTER EXERCISE Running averages of independent, identically dis-tributed random variablesConsider the following experiment, for an integer N  1. a Suppose U1, U2, . . . , UN aremutually independent, uniformly distributed random variables on the interval 0.5, 0.5 LetSn = U1 +  + Un denote the cumulative sum for 1  n  N. Simulate this experiment on an for 1  n  100 and the second showingcomputer and make two plots, the rst showing Snn for 1  n  10000. b Repeat part a, but change Sn to Sn = Y1 +  + Yn whereSnYk = tanUk. This choice makes each Yk have the Cauchy distribution, fY v =1+v2 ;see Example 3.8.6. Since the pdf fY is symmetric about zero, it is tempting to think that0 vfY vdv = + andEYk = 0, but that is false; EYk is not well dened because cid:82 cid:82 0 vfY vdv = . Thus, for any function gn dened for n  1, it is possible to selectan   and bn   so thatcid:82 bnintegralcid:82 vfY vdv = gn for all n. It is said, therefore, that the vfY vdv is indeterminate.an13.37.

Failure rate of a network with two parallel linksConsider the s  t network with two parallel links, as shown:2st13.12. PROBLEMS159Suppose that for each i, link i fails at time Ti, where T1 and T2 are independent, exponentiallydistributed with some parameter  > 0. The network fails at time T , where T = maxT1, T2.a Express F cT t = PT > t for t  0 in terms of t and .b Find the pdf of T.c Find the failure rate function, ht, for the network. Simplify your answer as much aspossible. Hint: Check that your expression for h satises h0 = 0 and limt ht =.d Find P minT1, T2 < t|T > t and verify that ht = PminT1, T2 < t|T > t. Thatis, the network failure rate at time t is  times the conditional probability that at leastone of the links has already failed by time t, given the network has not failed by time t.3.39.
