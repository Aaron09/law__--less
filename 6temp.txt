= Ac  Bcc. By Axiom E.2, Ac and Bc are events. So by Axiom E.3, Ac  Bc isan event. So by Axiom E.2 a second time, Ac  Bcc is an event, which is just AB.Property e.6 More generally, if B1, B2, . . . is a list of events then the intersection of all of theseevents the set of outcomes in all of them B1B2  is also an event. This is true by the samereason given for Property e.5, starting with the fact B1B2  = Bc2   c.1  Bc2In fact, the choice of which properties to make axioms is not unique. For example, we could have made Propertye.4 an axiom instead of Axiom E.1.1.2. AXIOMS OF PROBABILITY9Probability axioms The probability measure P is required to satisfy the following axioms:Axiom P.1 For any event A, P A  0.Axiom P.2 If A, B  F and if A and B are mutually exclusive, then P A  B = P A + P B.More generally, if E1, E2, . . . is an innite list i.e. countably innite collection of mutuallyexclusive events, P E1  E2    = P E1 + P E2 +  .Axiom P.3 P  = 1.If Axioms P.1-P.3 are satised and Axioms E.1-E.3 are also satised then the probabilitymeasure P has other intuitively reasonable properties. We list them here:Property p.4 For any event A, P Ac = 1P A. That is because A and Ac are mutually exclusiveevents and  = A Ac. So Axioms P.2 and P.3 yield P A + P Ac = P A Ac = P  = 1.Property p.5 For any event A, P A  1. That is because if A is an event, then P A = 1 P Ac  1 by Property p.4 and by the fact, from Axiom P.1, that P Ac  0.Property p.6 P  = 0. That is because  and  are complements of each other, so by Propertyp.4 and Axiom P.3, P  = 1  P  = 0.Property p.7 If A  B then P A  P B. That is because B = A  AcB and A and AcB aremutually exclusive, and P AcB  0, so P A  P A + P AcB = P A  AcB = P B.Property p.8 P A  B = P A + P B  P AB. That is because, as illustrated in Figure 1.1,A B can be written as the union of three mutually exclusive sets: A B = ABc AcBAB. SoP A  B = P ABc + P AcB + P AB= P ABc + P AB + P AcB + P AB  P AB= P A + P B  P AB.Property p.9 P A  B  C = P A + P B + P C  P AB  P AC  P BC + P ABC.This is a generalization of Property p.8 and can be proved in a similar way.Example 1.2.1 Toss of a fair coin Suppose the experiment is to ip a coin to see if it showsheads or tails. Using H for heads and T for tails, the experiment is modeled by the following choiceof  and P : = H, TPH = PT =12,F = H,T,H, T,P  = 0.P  = PH, T = 1,10CHAPTER 1. FOUNDATIONSExample 1.2.2 A particular experiment is to observe the color of a trac signal at the time it isapproached by a vehicle. The sample space is  = green, yellow, red and we let any subset of be an event. What probability measure, P , should we choose? Since there are three colors, we coulddeclare them to be equally likely, and thus have probability 1/3 each. But here is an intuitivelymore reasonable choice. Suppose when we examine the signal closely, we notice that the color ofthe signal goes through cycles of duration 75 seconds. In each cycle the signal dwells on green for30 seconds, then dwells on yellow for 5 seconds, then dwells on red for 40 seconds. Assuming thatthe arrival time of the vehicle is random, and not at all connected to the signal in particular, thetrac signal is isolated and not synchronized with other signals that the vehicle passes then itseems intuitively reasonable to assign probabilities to the colors that are proportional to their dwelltimes. Hence, we declare that Pgreen = 3075 = 275 = 815 .Note that the three outcomes are not equally likely.15 , and Pred = 405 , Pyellow = 575 = 11.3 Calculating the size of various setsAn important class of probability spaces are those such that the set of outcomes, , is nite, and all|A|outcomes have equal probability. Therefore, the probability for any event A is P A =|| , where|A| is the number of elements in A and || is the number of elements in . This notation |A| isthe same as what we use for absolute value, but the argument is a set, not a value. The number ofelements in a set is called the cardinality of the set. Thus, it is important to be able to count thenumber of elements in various sets. Such counting problems are the topic of this section.Principle of counting Often we are faced with nding the number of vectors or sets satisfyingcertain conditions. For example, we might want to nd the number of pairs of the form X,N suchthat X  H, T and N  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These pairs correspond to outcomes of an experiment,in which a coin is ipped and a die is rolled, with X representing the side showing on the coin Hfor heads or T for tails and N being the number showing on the die. For example, H, 3, or H3for short, corresponds to the coin showing heads and the die showing three. The set of all possibleoutcomes can be listed as:H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 T 5 T 6.Obviously there are twelve possible outcomes. There are two ways to choose X, and for every choiceof X, there are six choices of N. So the number of possible outcomes is 2  6 = 12.This example is a special case of the principle of counting: If= Ac  Bcc. By Axiom E.2, Ac and Bc are events. So by Axiom E.3, Ac  Bc isan event. So by Axiom E.2 a second time, Ac  Bcc is an event, which is just AB.Property e.6 More generally, if B1, B2, . . . is a list of events then the intersection of all of theseevents the set of outcomes in all of them B1B2  is also an event.
