CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLES3.5.3 The Erlang distributionLet Tr denote the time of the rth count of a Poisson process. Thus, Tr = U1 +  + Ur, whereU1, . . . , Ur are independent, exponentially distributed random variables with parameter . Oneway to derive the pdf of fTr is to use this characterization of Tr and the method of Section 4.5.2,showing how to nd the pdf of the sum of independent continuous-type random variables. But thefollowing method is less work. Notice that for a xed time t, the event Tr > t can be written asNt  r  1, because the rth count happens after time t if and only if the number of counts thathappened by time t is less than or equal to r  1. Therefore,PTr > t =The pdf is thusr1cid:88expttk.k=0k!dt= exptfTr t =  dPTr > tcid:32r1cid:88cid:32r1cid:88cid:32r1cid:88= expt= exptk=0k=0cid:33cid:33cid:33kktk1k!ktk1k  1!k+1tkk!k=1 r1cid:88 r1cid:88 r2cid:88k=1k=0tkk!k+1tkk!k+1tkk!k=0exptrtr1r  1!.=The distribution of Tr is called the Erlang distribution2 with parameters r and . The mean of Tris r , because Tr is the sum of r random variables, each with mean 1/. It is shown in Example4.8.1 that VarTr = r2 .Recall from Section 3.4 that the exponential distribution is the limit of a scaled geometricrandom variable. In the same way, the sum of r independent exponential random variables is thescaled limit of the sum of r independent geometric random variables. That is exactly what wejust showed: The Erlang distribution with parameters r and  is the limit of a scaled negativebinomial random variable hSr, where Sr has the negative binomial distribution with parameters rand p = h.by replacing the term r  1! by r, where  is the gamma function dened by r =cid:82 2The Erlang distribution can be generalized to the case r is any positive real number not necessarily an integertr1etdt. Distributionsin this more general family are called gamma distributions. Thus, Erlang distributions are special cases of Gammadistributions for the case that r is a positive integer, in which case r = r  1!.03.6. LINEAR SCALING OF PDFS AND THE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION1133.6 Linear scaling of pdfs and the Gaussian distribution3.6.1 Scaling rule for pdfsLet X be a random variable with pdf fX and let Y = aX + b where a > 0.3 The pdf of Y is givenby the following scaling rule:Y = aX + b  fY v = fX.3.5We explain what the scaling rule means graphically, assuming a  1. The situation for 0 < a  1 issimilar. To obtain fY from fX , rst stretch the graph of fX horizontally by a factor a and shrink itvertically by a factor a. That operation leaves the area under the graph equal to one, and producesthe pdf of aX. Then shift the graph horizontally by b to the right if b > 0 or to the left if b < 0.Here is a derivation of the scaling rule 3.5. Since a > 0, the event aX + b  v is the sameascid:8X  vbacid:18 v  bcid:19 1aacid:9 , so the CDF of Y can be expressed as follows:cid:27X  v  bcid:18 v  bFY v = PaX + b  v = Pcid:26acid:19 1fY v = F cid:48Y v = fX.aacid:18 v  bcid:19.a= FXDierentiate FY v with respect to v, using the chain rule of calculus and the fact F cid:48obtain 3.5:X = fX , toSection 3.2 recounts how the mean, variance, and standard deviation of Y are related to themean, variance, and standard deviation of X, in case Y = aX + b. These relations are the sameones discussed in Section 2.2 for discrete-type random variables, namely:EY  = aEX + bVarY = a2VarXY = aX .In particular, the standardized version of a random variable X, XXone.X, has mean zero and varianceExample 3.6.1 Let X denote the pdf of the high temperature, in degrees C Celsius, for acertain day of the year in some city. Let Y denote the pdf of the same temperature, but in degreesF Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is Y = 1.8X + 32. This is the linear transformation thatmaps zero degrees C to 32 degrees F and 100 degrees C to 212 degrees F.a Express fY in terms of fX .b Sketch fY in the case X is uniformly distributed over the interval 15, 20.a By the scaling formula with a = 1.8 and b = 32, fY c = fX  c32Solution:b The case when X is uniformly distributed over 15, 20 leads to Y uniformly distributed over59, 68. This is illustrated in Figure 3.9. The pdf of X is shown at the top of the gure. The pdf1.8 /1.8.3The case a < 0 is discussed in Example 3.8.4, included in the section on functions of a random variable.114CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESFigure 3.9: Rescaling from degrees C to degrees F.of 1.8X is shown in the middle of the gure. It is obtained by stretching fX out from the originby a factor 1.8, and at the same time reducing the height by the same factor, so the area under thecurve is still one. Finally, fY is obtained by sliding the pdf of 1.8X to the right by 32.Example 3.6.2 Let T denote the duration of a waiting time in a service system, measured inseconds. Suppose T is
