e total maximum ow rate is 10. By considering all four network states, wearrive at the following expression for the pmf of X, the capacity of Network F :pX 0 = p1p2 pX 10 = q1p2 pX 20 = p1q2 pX 30 = q1q2.Let Y denote the capacity of s t ow network G. We will nd the pmf of Y. If none of the linksfail, the network capacity is 30, because ow can be carried from s to t at rate 30 by sending owover links 1, 2, 3, and 4 from left to right at the link capacities, and sending ow up the middlelink at rate 10. If one or more of links from 1, 2, 3, 4 fails, then Y < 30, because either the totalow out of s would be less than 30 or the total ow into t would be less than 30. If link 5 fails,then the total ow must be less than or equal to 20, because at most 10 units of ow could berelayed over links 1 and 2 in series and at most 10 units of ow could be relayed over links 3 and4 in services. So if any of the links fail then Y is less than 30. Thus, pY 30 = q1q2q3q4q5. At theother extreme, Y = 0 if and only if every s  t path has at least one failed link. Thus, pY 0 is thesame as the outage probability of s  t network E considered previously. The other two possiblevalues of Y are 10 or 20. In order to have Y = 20, to begin with, both links 2 and 3 must work,or else there wouldnt be enough capacity for ow out of s and enough capacity for ow into t.If links 2 and 3 work, then Y = 20 if link 5 fails and links 1 and 4 work, or if link 5 works andat least one of links 1 or 4 fails. Therefore, pY 20 = q2q3p5q1q4 + q5p1 + p4  p1p4. Finally,pY 10 = 1  pY 0  pY 20  pY 30.A more systematic way to calculate the pmf of Y is to enumerate all the network states, calculatethe capacity of each state, and then for each capacity value, add together all probabilities of all72CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESstates with that capacity. The rst few lines of such a table are shown in Table 2.4. For example,pY 10 is the sum of all probabilities in rows such that the capacity shown in the row is 10.Table 2.4: A table for calculating the distribution of capacity of network G.State0000000001000100001100100001010011000111...11111capacity probabilityq1q2q3q4q5q1q2q3q4p5q1q2q3p4q5q1q2q3p4p5q1q2p3q4q5q1q2p3q4p5q1q2p3p4q5q1q2p3p4p53020201010101010...0...p1p2p3p4p52.12.4 Analysis of an array codeThe array shown in Figure 2.12.4 below illustrates a two-dimensional error detecting code for usein digital systems such as computer memory or digital communication systems.

The array is lled out to a total of 64 bits by the addition of arow and column of parity bits, selected so that all rows and columns have even parity. The idea isthat all 64 bits should be stored or transmitted. During storage or transmission, one or more bitsmight be changed due to a physical deviation. A bit that has been changed is said to be in error,10000000000000000001111111111111111111101111011101000111111111100column parityrow parity datablockoverall parity2.12. RELIABILITY73and the binary array with ones at the locations of the bits in error is called the error pattern. Thereare 264 error patterns, including the pattern with no errors. When the data is needed, the readeror receiver rst checks to see if all rows and columns have even parity. If yes, the data is deemedto be correct.If no, the data is deemed to be corrupted, and we say the errors were detected.Since there may be backup copies in storage, or the data can possibly be retransmitted, the eectof errors is not severe if they are detected. But the eect of errors can be severe if they are notdetected, which can happen for some nonzero error patterns.It is explained next that any error pattern with either one, two, or three bit errors is detected,but certain error patterns with four bit errors are not detected. An error pattern is undetected ifand only if the parity of each row and column is even, which requires that the parity of the entireerror pattern be even. Thus, any error pattern with an odd number of bit errors is detected. Inparticular, error patterns with one or three bit errors are detected. If there are two bit errors, theyare either in dierent rows or in dierent columns or both. If they are in dierent rows then thoserows have odd parity, and if they are in dierent columns then those columns have odd parity. So,either way, the error pattern is detected. A pattern with four bit errors is undetected if and onlyif there are two rows and two columns such that the bit errors are at the four intersections of thetwo rows and two columns.We now discuss how to bound the probability of undetected error, assuming that each bit is inerror with probability 0.001, independently of all other bits. Let Y denote the number of bits inerror. As already discussed, there can be undetected bit errors only if Y  4. So the probability thereexist undetected bit errors is less than or equal to PY  4. We have Y = X1 +  + X64,
