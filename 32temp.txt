network D.Combining these yields:5 P F cP outage in network E = p5P outage in network C + 1  p5P outage in network D.Another way to calculate P F  for network E is by closer comparison to network D. If thesame four links used in network D are used along with link 5 in network E, then network E failswhenever network D fails. Moreover, some thought shows there are exactly two ways network Ecan fail such that network D does not fail, namely, links 1,4, and 5 are the only ones that fail, orlinks 2, 3, and 5 are the only ones that fail. So P F  for network D is equal to P F  for network Dplus p1q2q3p4p5 + q1p2p3q4p5, where qi = 1 pi for all i. This yields the outage probability given inFigure 2.12. For example, if pi = 0.001 for 1  i  5, then P F  = 0.000002001995002  0.000002.The network outage probability is determined mainly by the probability that both links 1 and 3fail or both links 2 and 4 fail. Thus, the outage probability of network E is about the same as fornetwork D.Applying the union bound The union bound doesnt apply and isnt needed for network A.For network B, F = F1  F2. The union bound for two events implies that P F   p1 + p2. Thenumerical value is 0.002 if p1 = p2 = 0.001.For network C, F = F1F3  F1F4  F2F3  F2F4 so that the union bound for m = 4 yieldsP F   p1p3 + p1p4 + p2p3 + p2p4 = p1 + p2p3 + p4. This upper bound could also be obtained byrst upper bounding the probability of failure of the upper branch by p1 + p2 and the lower branchby p3 + p4 and multiplying these bounds because the branches are independent. The numericalvalue is 0.000004 in case pi = 0.001 for 1  i  4.For network D, F = F1F3  F2F4. The union bound for two events yields P F   p1p3 + p2p4.The numerical value is 0.000002 in case pi = 0.001 for 1  i  4.Fo network E, F = F1F3  F2F4  F1F5F4  F3F5F2. The union bound for four events yieldsP F   p1p3 + p2p4 + p1p5p4 + p3p5p2. The numerical value is 0.000002002 in case pi = 0.001 for1  i  5, which is approximately 0.000002.Note that for all four networks, B through E, the numerical value of the union bound, in casepi = 0.001 for all i, is close to the exact value of network outage computed above.70CHAPTER 2. DISCRETE-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESCalculation by exhaustive listing of network states Another way to calculate the outageprobability of an s  t network is to enumerate all the possible network states, determine whichones correspond to network outage, and then add together the probabilities of those states. Themethod becomes intractable for large networks,3 but it is often useful for small networks and itsharpens intuition about most likely failure modes.For example, consider network C. Since there are four links, the network state can be representedby a length four binary string such as 0110, such that the ith bit in the string is one if link i fails,This computation is illustrated in Table 2.3, where we let qi = 1  pi. For example, if the networkTable 2.3: A table for calculating P F  for network C.State Network fails? probability0000000100100011010001010110011110001001101010111100110111101111nononononoyesyesyesnoyesyesyesnoyesyesyesp1p2q3p4p1p2p3q4p1p2p3p4q1p2q3p4q1p2p3q4q1p2p3p4p1q2q3p4p1q2p3q4p1q2p3p4state is 0110, meaning that links 2 and 3 fail and links 1 and 4 dont, then the network fails. Theprobability of this state is q1p2p3q4. For given numerical values of p1 through p4, numerical valuescan be computed for the last column of the table, and the sum of those values is P F .2.12.3 Distribution of the capacity of a ow networkAn s  t ow network is an s  t network such that each link has a capacity. Two s  t ownetworks are shown in Figure 2.13. We assume as before that each link i fails with probability pi.If a link fails, it cannot carry any ow. If a link does not fail, it can carry ow at a rate up to3From a computational complexity point of view, the problem of computing the outage probability, also called thereliability problem, has been shown to be P -space complete, meaning exact solution for large networks is probablynot feasible.2.12.

Forexample, the units could be gallons per minute for an irrigation system, packets per second fora communication network, or vehicles per hour for a highway transportation system.For simplicity we have chosen to work with undirected links, and we assume that the ow canbe in either direction on a link, up to the total capacity of the link. We assume that ow can besplit among multiple paths. The capacity of an s t ow network is the maximum ow rate from sto t. The capacity is random because of the possible link failures. We will compute the pmf of thecapacity of each of the two networks.We begin with Network F . If both of the links are working, then the capacity is 30, because thetop link can carry ow at rate 10 and the bottom link can carry ow at rate 20. If link 2 fails andlink 1 does not, then thnetwork D.Combining these yields:5 P F cP outage in network E = p5P outage in network C + 1  p5P outage in network D.Another way to calculate P F  for network E is by closer comparison to network D.

Moreover, some thought shows there are exactly two ways network Ecan fail such that network D does not fail, namely, links 1,4, and 5 are the only ones that fail, orlinks 2, 3, and 5 are the only ones that fail. So P F  for network D is equal to P F  for network Dplus p1q2q3p4p5 + q1p2p3q4p5, where qi = 1 pi for all i. This yields the outage probability given inFigure 2.12. For example, if pi = 0.001 for 1  i  5, then P F  = 0.000002001995002  0.000002.The network outage probability is determined mainly by the probability that both links 1 and 3fail or both links 2 and 4 fail.

The union bound for two events yields P F   p1p3 + p2p4.The numerical value is 0.000002 in case pi = 0.001 for 1  i  4.Fo network E, F = F1F3  F2F4  F1F5F4  F3F5F2.
