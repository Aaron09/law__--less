Assume that, basedon past performance, the returns on investment for the instruments have the following means andstandard deviations.InstrumentExpected value after one yearStandard deviation of value after one yearStock fund S S = 1.10 i.e., 10% expected gainBond fund B B = 1.00 i.e., expected gain is zeroT-bills TT = 1.02 i.e. 2% gainS=0.15B=0.15T =0So T  1.02. Also assume the correlation coecient between the stocks and bonds is S,B = 0.8.Some fraction of the funds is to be invested in stocks, some fraction in bonds, and the rest in T-bills,and at the end of the year the return per unit of funds is R. There is no single optimal choice ofwhat values to use for these fractions; there is a tradeo between the mean, R, larger is betterand the standard deviation, R smaller is better. Plot your answers to the parts below using ahorizontal axis for mean return ranging from 1.0 to 1.1, and a vertical axis for standard deviationranging from 0 to 0.15. Label the points PS = 1.1, 0.15, PB = 1, 0.15 and PT = 1.02, 0 on theplot corresponding to the three possibilities for putting all the funds into one instrument.a Let R = S + 1 T, so R is the random return resulting when a fraction  of the fundsis put into stocks and a fraction 1   is put into T-bills. Determine and plot the set of R, Rpairs as  ranges from zero to one.b Let R = S + 1  B, so R is the random return resulting when a fraction  of thefunds is put into stocks and a fraction 1   is put into bonds. Determine and plot the set ofR, R pairs as  ranges from zero to one. Hint: Use the fact S,B = 0.8..c Combining parts a and b, let R, = R + 1  T, so R, is the random returnresulting when a fraction 1   of the funds is invested in T-bills as in part a, and a fraction  ofthe funds is invested in the same mixture of stock and bond funds considered in part b. For each4.8.

Hint: You may express your answers in terms of R, R found in part b.out the set of achievable mean, standard deviation pairs. An achievable pair cid:101R,cid:101R is said tobe strictly better than an achievable pair R, R if either R <cid:101R and R cid:101R or R cid:101Rand R > cid:101R.. An achievable pair cid:101R,cid:101R is undominated if there is no other achievable pairstrictly better than it. Identify the set of undominated achievable pairs.Solution a By linearity of expectation, R = S + 1 T . Since T  1.02, 222from PT to PS. See Figure 4.22.= VarS =S, and so R = S.

Since T  1.02, 2R = 2VarR.Thus R, = R. As  ranges from 0 to 1, the point R,, R, sweeps out the line segmentfrom PT to the point found in part b corresponding to . Those lines for   0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8are shown as dashed lines in Figure 4.22.d By part c, the set of all achievable points is the union of all line segments from PT topoints on the curve found in partb. Consider the line through PT that is tangent to the curvefound in part b. The set of undominated points consists of the segment of that line from PT upto the point of tangency, and then continues along the curve found in part b up to the point PS.See Figure 4.22. Thus, the optimal and only portfolio with zero standard deviation is the oneinvesting all funds in T-bills. For small, positive standard deviation, the optimal portfolio is touse a mixture of all three instruments. For larger standard deviation less than 0.15, the optimalportfolio is to use a mixture of stock and bond funds only. Finally, the largest mean return of 0.10is uniquely achieved by investing only in the stock fund, for which the standard deviation is 0.15.4.9 Minimum mean square error estimation4.9.1 Constant estimatorsLet Y be a random variable
