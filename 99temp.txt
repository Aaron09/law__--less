So P A = 20cid:1 = 10 ways to ll out the rest of the team, so P A|B = 10b Given Bob is selected, there are 20 ways to ll out the rest of the team, but if Alice is20 =0.5.

Binomial distribution IIa The number of weeks that your investment doubles in value is a binomial random variableY with parameters 5, 12 . Since the investment halves in value during the remaining5  Y weeks, and each halving cancels one doubling, we have that X = 32  22Y 5. Thepossible values of X are 1, 4, 16, 64, 256, and 1024, corresponding to Y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,5 respectively.32 . PX = 4 = PY = 1 = 532 .32 . PX = 64 = PY = 3 = 1032 .32 . PX = 1024 = PY = 5 = 132 .b PX = 1 = PY = 0 = 1PX = 16 = PY = 2 = 10PX = 256 = PY = 4 = 5To elaborate on the above solution, perhaps it would help to consider some particularoutcomes for the ve weeks. Since there are two possibilities for each week, there are25 = 32 possibilities for the ve weeks. For example, if the value is cut in half all veweeks represent this by 00000 then X = 1 start out with 32 and divide it by 2 vetimes. If the investment doubles the rst week and is cut in half the other four weeksrepresent this by 10000 then X = 4 thered be 64 after one week and that gets cut inhalf four times. Similarly, X = 4 if the investment doubles the second week and is cut inhalf the other four weeks. Continuing, we see there are 5 ways for X = 4. The possiblevalues of X are 1,4, 16, 64, 256, 1024. X is not a binomially distributed random variable.But X is determined by the number of good weeks, when the investment doubles.Itdoesnt depend on the order of good and bad weeks. The number of good weeks out ofthe ve weeks has the binomial distributionit is the number of successes for a speciednumber of independent trials with the same success probability.c EX = 1  132 + 4  532 + 16  1032 + 64  1032 + 256  532 + 1024  1commercial understates the performance - undoubtedly a rst!d PX < 32 = PX = 1 + PX = 4 + PX = 16 = 1/2.32 = 97.65625.
