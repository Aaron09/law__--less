Thus, the conditional pdf fY |X v|u is dened foru  0, 1.In such a question one might wonder whether u = 0 should beincluded. That is a ne point and graders are hereby asked not to pay attention to it.Note:e This requires integration over the subset of the support where u < v, which is shadedmore darkly in the sketch of the support of the pdf.PX < Y  ===ucid:90 2ucid:90 1cid:18cid:90 1cid:32cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:1210u33034340u + v2dvduu2 +du34+cid:19cid:33cid:12cid:12cid:12cid:12107u337u412=14+716=11164.12.

V can be close to zero because the same istrue for H and R. The largest V can be is , which happens if H = R = 1. Thus, thedistribution of V has support 0, .c FV c = 0 for c  0 and FV c = 1 for c  . So x c with 0  c   and focus oncalculating FV c = PHR2  c. It is the same as the area of the region u, v 0, 12 : uv2  c, which is pictured below as a shaded region.The curved part of the boundary is given by the equation uv2 = c, or equivalently, .

Functions of random variablesThe variable Z takes values in the positive reals, and for a  0, FZa = PZ  a is equalto the integral of the joint pdf over the shaded region:vu11cid:47c/6.6. SOLUTIONS TO EVEN NUMBERED PROBLEMS275The integral can be computed using either integration with respect to u on the outside orintegration with respect to v on the outside.

That is, Z has the Erlang distributionwith parameters r = 2 and  = 1. This could have been deduced without calculation. Thejoint CDF is the same as the joint CDF of two independent exponential random variables,conditioned on the rst to be smaller than the second. Since the two random variables areindependent and identically distributed, such conditioning does not change the distributionof the sum, and the sum of two independent exponentials has the Erlang distribution withr = 2.4.16. A function of two random variablesR1+R2The current I is given by I = 1. One approach to this problem is to use the fact that thedistribution of R1 +R2 has the triangular pdf as found in Example 4.5.4. Here we take a direct2 ,. For a in that range, FI a = PI approach. Note that I takes values in the set  1a = P1/R1 + R2  a = PR1 + R2  a1. Since R1, R2 is uniformly distributed overthe unit square region 0, 12, the probability PR1 + R2  a1 is the area of the shadedregion, consisting of the intersection of 0, 12 and the half-plane u, v : u + v  a1. Theshape of the intersection is qualitatively dierent for a < 1 and a > 1; an example of each ofthese two cases is shown in the gure.We thus consider these two cases separately.In case 0.5 < a < 1 the shaded region istriangular with area one half base times height. The edge of the half plane, given by u + v =a1, intersects the line v = 1 at u = a1  1. Therefore, the width of the triangular regionavua/2u!1a!1vvu2!1111a0.5<      < 1a1 <     <!ais 1  a1  1 or 2  a1, and the height is the same. In case 1 < a <  the shaded regionis 0, 12 with a triangular region removed from the lower left corner, so its area is one minusthe area of the triangle. The width and height of the triangle are a1.
