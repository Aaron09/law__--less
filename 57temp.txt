 g1c is divided by this ratio in 3.8. Assuming Figure 3.21 is drawn to scale, the derivativeof g at g1c is about 1/4. Therefore the density of Y at c is about four times larger than thedensity of X at g1c.7Prove this by dierentiating both sides of the identity gg1c = c!1abguuABcXf  ug   c3.8. FUNCTIONS OF A RANDOM VARIABLE135A variation of this example would be to assume g is strictly decreasing. Then 3.8 holds withgcid:48g1c replaced by |gcid:48g1c|. More generally, suppose g is continuously dierentiable with noat spots, but increasing on some intervals and decreasing on other intervals. For any real numberc let u1, . . . , un be the values of u such that f uk = c for all k. Here n  0. Then 3.8 becomesfY c =cid:80k fX uk1|gcid:48uk| .Example 3.8.11 Suppose X is a continuous-type random variable with CDF FX . Let Y be theresult of applying FX to X, that is, Y = FX X. Find the distribution of Y.Solution: Since Y takes values in the interval 0, 1, let 0 < v < 1. Since FX increases continuouslyfrom zero to one, there is a value cv such that FX cv = v. Then PFX X  v = PX  cv =FX cv = v. That is, FX X is uniformly distributed over the interval 0, 1. This result may seemsurprising at rst, but it is natural if it is thought of in terms of percentiles. Consider, for example,the heights of all the people within a large group.Ignore ties. A particular person from thegroup is considered to be in the 90th percentile according to height, if the fraction of people in thegroup shorter than that person is 90%. So 90% of the people are in the 90th percentile or smaller.Similarly, 50% of the people are in the 50th percentile or smaller. So the percentile ranking ofa randomly selected person from the group is uniformly distributed over the range from zero toone hundred percent. This result does not depend on the distribution of heights within the group.For this example, Y can be interpreted as the rank of X expressed as a fraction rather than as apercentile relative to the distribution assumed for X.3.8.2 Generating a random variable with a specied distributionAn important step in many computer simulations of random systems is to generate a randomvariable with a specied CDF. This is often done by applying a function to a random variable thatis uniformly distributed on the interval 0, 1. The method is basically to use Example 3.8.11 inreverseif applying FX to X produces a uniformly distributed random variable, applying F 1 toa uniform random variable should produce a random variable with CDF F. Let F be a functionsatisfying the three properties required of a CDF, as described in Proposition 3.1.5, and let U beuniformly distributed over the interval 0, 1. The problem is to nd a function g so that F is theCDF of gU . An appropriate function g is given by the inverse function of F . Although F maynot be strictly increasing, a suitable version of F 1 always exists, dened for 0 < u < 1 byF 1u = minc : F c  u.3.9If the graphs of F and F 1 are closed up by adding vertical lines at jump points, then the graphsare reections of each other about the line through the origin of slope one, as illustrated in Figure3.22. It is not hard to check that for any real co and uo with 0 < uo < 1,uo  F co.F 1uo  coif and only if136CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESFigure 3.22: A CDF and its inverse.Thus, if X = F 1U  thenFX c = PF 1U   c = PU  F c = F c,so indeed F is the CDF of X.Example 3.8.12 Find a function g so that, if U is uniformly distributed over the interval 0, 1,gU  is exponentially distributed with parameter  = 1.Solution: The desired exponential distribution has support R+ and CDF F given by: F c =1  ec for c  0 and F c = 0 for c < 0. Well let gu = F 1u. Since F is strictly andcontinuously increasing over the support, if 0 < u < 1 then the value c of F 1u is such thatF c = u. That is, we would like 1 ec = u which is equivalent to ec = 1 u, or c =  ln1 u.Thus, F 1u =  ln1  u. So we can take gu =  ln1  u for 0 < u < 1. To double check theanswer, note that if c  0, thenP ln1  U   c = Pln1  U   c = P1  U  ec = PU  1  ec = F c.The choice of g is not unique in general. For example, 1 U has the same distribution as U , so theCDF of  lnU  is also F .Example 3.8.13 Find a function g so that, if U is uniformly distributed over the interval 0, 1,then gU  has the distribution of the number showing for the experiment of rolling a fair die.Solution: The desired CDF of gU  is shown in Figure 3.1. Using g = F 1 and using 3.9 orthe graphical method illustrated in Figure 3.22 to nd F 1, we get that for 0 < u < 1, gu = i for6 < u  ii16 for 1  i  6. To double check the answer, note that if 1  i  6, thencid:26 i  16cid:27PgU  = i = P< U  i6=16,so gU  has the correct pmf, and hence the correct CDF.Fc11!1uF uc3.8.
