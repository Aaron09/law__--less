 holds. Some propositions are given in this section thatcan often be used to help determine whether X and Y are independent. To begin, the followingproposition gives a condition equivalent to independence, based on conditional pdfs.Proposition 4.4.2 X and Y are independent if and only if the following condition holds: For allu  R, either fX u = 0 or fY |X v|u = fY v for all v  R.Proof. if part If the condition holds, then for any u, v  R2 there are two cases: i fX u = 0 sofX,Y u, v = 0 so fX,Y u, v = fX ufY v. ii fX u > 0 and then fX,Y u, v = fX ufY |X v|u =fX ufY v. So in either case, fX,Y u, v = fX ufY v. Since this is true for all u, v  R2, X andY are independent.only if part If X and Y are independent, then fX,Y u, v = fX ufY v for all u, v  R2, so iffX u > 0, then fY |X v|u = fX,Y u,vfX u = fY v, for all v  R.The remaining propositions have to do with the notion of product sets. Suppose A and B eachconsist of a nite union of disjoint nite intervals of the real line. Let |A| denote the sum of thelengths of all intervals making up A, and |B| denote the sum of the lengths of all intervals makingup B. The product set of A and B, denoted by A B, is dened by A B = u, v : u  A, v  B,as illustrated in Figure 4.12. The total area of the product set, |A  B|, is equal to |A|  |B|.Denition 4.4.3 A subset S in R2 has the swap property if for any two points a, b  S andc, d  S, the points a, d and b, c are also in S.The swap property holds for a product set A  B because if a, b  A  B and c, d  A  B,then both a and c are in A and both c and d are in B, so a, d and b, c must be in A  B. It isnot dicult to show that the converse is true too, so following proposition holds.4.4.INDEPENDENCE OF RANDOM VARIABLES177Figure 4.12: The product set A  B for sets A and B.Proposition 4.4.4 swap test for product sets Let S  R2. Then S is a product set if and only ifit has the swap property.The next proposition gives a necessary condition for X and Y to be independent. While thecondition is not sucient for independence, it is sucient for an important special case, covered inthe corollary to the proposition.Proposition 4.4.5 If X and Y are independent, jointly continuous-type random variables, thenthe support of fX,Y is a product set.Proof. By assumption, fX,Y u, v = fX ufY v. So if fX,Y a, b > 0 and fX,Y c, d > 0, it mustbe that fX a, fY b, fX c, and fY d are all strictly positive, so fX,Y a, d > 0 and fX,Y b, d > 0.That is, the support of fX,Y has the swap property; it is a product set by Proposition 4.4.4.Corollary 4.4.6 Suppose X, Y  is uniformly distributed over a set S in the plane. Then X andY are independent if and only if S is a product set.Proof.if If X and Y are independent, the set S must be a product set by Proposition 4.4.5.only if  Conversely, if S is a product set, then S = A B for some sets A and B, and |S| = |A||B|.Thus, the joint density of X and Y is given bycid:26 1|A||B| u  A, v  B0else.fX,Y u, v =The standard integral formulas for marginal pdfs, 4.7 and 4.8, imply that X is uniformlydistributed over A, Y is uniformly distributed over B. So fX,Y u.v = fX ufY v for all u, v.Therefore, X is independent of Y.Example 4.4.7 Decide whether X and Y are independent for each of the following three pdfs:cid:26 Cu2v2 u, v  0, u + v  1a fX,Y u, v =0else,for an appropriate choice of C.ABuv                                                                  178b fX,Y u, v =c fX,Y u, v =CHAPTER 4.

This one is a little tricky because the functionSolution:Cu2v2 does factor into a function of u times a function of v. However, fX,Y u, v is only equalto Cu2v2 over a portion of the plane. One reason only one reason is needed! X and Y are notindependent is because the support of fX,Y is not a product set. For example, fX,Y 0.3, 0.6 > 0 andfX,Y 0.6, 0.3 > 0, but fX,Y 0.6, 0.6 cid:54> 0. That is, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.6, 0.3 are both in the suppert,but 0.6, 0.6 is not, so the support fails the swap test and is not a product set by Proposition4.4.4. Another reason X and Y are not independent is that the conditional distribution of Y givenX = u depends on u: for u xed the conditional density of Y given X = u has support equal tothe interval 0, 1 u. Since the support of the conditional pdf of Y given X = u depends on u, theconditional pdf itself depends on u. So X and Y are not independent by Proposition 4.4.2.b No, X and Y are not independent. One reason is that the function u+v on 0, 12 does not factorinto a function of u times a function of v.1 Another reason is that the conditional distributions ofY given X = u depend on u: fY |X v|u =for 0  u  1.
