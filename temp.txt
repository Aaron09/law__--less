Its been a busy week, but, youd know that better than anyone; and Im the luckiest kid on the planet for it. You know my life, my humor, my friends  me. All from halfway across the country, I dont know how you do it but youre still the most relevant person in my life. The only one who knows every worthless detail of my life, from all the attractive men Ive fainted over to my sudden transformations into sea mammals. Weve somehow made just as memories from two thousand fifty-three miles away as we did before.  So a note here, a note in the back, and all my favorite memories of you in the middle.  Thanks hoe.             L O L. Favorite memories?? With u? Ha. Pls  u lil .
