ariable. Suppose instead that we would like to generate Bernoulli randomvariables with parameter p = 0.5 using ips of a biased coin. That is, suppose that the probabilitythe coin shows H for heads is a, where a is some number that might not be precisely known.Explain how this coin can be used to generate independent Bernoulli random variables with p = 0.5.Solution: Here is one solution. Flip the coin repeatedly, and look at the outcomes two at a time.If the rst two outcomes are the same, ignore them. If they are dierent, then they are either HTa head followed by a tail or T H, and these two possibilities each have probability a1 a. In thiscase, give as output either H or T , whichever appeared rst in those two ips. ThenP output = H|there is output after two ips= P rst two ips are HT|rst two ips are HT or T H=P rst two ips are HT P rst two ips are HT  + P rst two ips are T H=a1  a2a1  a= 0.5.Then repeat this procedure using the third and fourth ips, and so fourth. One might wonderhow many times the biased coin must be ipped on average to produce one output. The requirednumber of pairs of ips has the geometric distribution, with parameter 2a1  a. Therefore, themean number of pairs of coin ips required until an HT or T H is observed is 1/2a1 a. So themean number of coin ips required to produce one Bernoulli random variable with parameter 0.5using the biased coin by this method is 1/a1  a.3.8.3 The area rule for expectation based on the CDFThere is a simple rule for determining the expectation, EX, of a random variable X directly fromits CDF, called the area rule for expectation. See Figure 3.23, which shows an example of a CDFFigure 3.23: EX is the area of the + region minus the area of the  region.0cid:239cuu=1F  cXXF    ucid:2391+138CHAPTER 3. CONTINUOUS-TYPE RANDOM VARIABLESFX plotted as a function of c in the c  u plane. Consider the innite strip bounded by the c axisand the horizontal line given by u = 1. Then EX is the area of the region in the strip to the rightof the u axis above the CDF, minus the area of the region in the strip to the left of the u axisbelow the CDF, as long as at least one of the two regions has nite area. The area rule can also bewritten as an equation, by integrating over the c axis:cid:90 0cid:90 0EX =1  FX cdc cid:90 10EX =F 1X udu.FX cdc,3.103.11or equivalently, by integrating over the u axis:The area rule can be justied as follows. As noted in Section 3.8.2, if U is a random variable uni-formly distributed on the interval 0, 1, then F 1X U  has the same distribution as X. Therefore, italso has the same expectation: EX = EF 1X U  is a function of U, its expectation0 F 1can be found by LOTUS. Therefore, EX = EF 1X udu, which proves 3.11, andhence, the area rule itself, because the right hand sides of both 3.10 and 3.11 are equal to thearea of the region in the strip to the right of the u axis above the CDF, minus the area of the regionin the strip to the left of the u axis below the CDF.X U  =cid:82 1X U .

Suppose T is a positive random variable with pdf fT . Thefailure rate function, h = ht : t  0, of T and of the item itself is dened by the followinglimit:htcid:52= lim0P t < T  t + |T > tThat is, given the item is still working after t time units, the probability the item fails within thenext  time units is ht + o..cid:19The failure rate function is determined by the distribution of T as follows:FT t +   FT tPt < T  t + ht = lim0PT > t= lim01  FT tcid:18lim0FT t +   FT t==11  FT t1  FT tfT t,Conversely, a nonnegative function h = ht : t  0 with cid:82 because the pdf fT is the derivative of the CDF FT .probability distribution with failure rate function h as follows.

To derive 3.13, and henceshow it gives the unique distribution with failure rate function h, start with the fact that we wouldlike F cid:48/1  F  = h. Equivalently, ln1  F cid:48 = h, or, integrating over 0, t, ln1  F t =0 hsds. Since F should be the CDF of a nonnegative continuous type random0 hsds, which is equivalent to 3.13.For a given failure rate function h, the mean lifetime of the item can be computed by rstcomputing the CDF by and then using the area rule for expectation, 3.10, which, since theln1  F 0 cid:82 tvariable, F 0 = 0 or ln1 F 0 = 0. So ln1 F t = cid:82 tlifetime T is nonnegative, becomes ET  =cid:82 0 1  F tdt.Example 3.9.1 a Find the failure rate function for an exponentially distributed random variable2 for t  0.with parameter . b Find the distribution with the linear failure rate function ht = tc Find the failure rate function of T = minT1, T2, where T1 and T2 are independent randomvariables such that T1 has failure rate function h1 and
