Some identities satised by binomial coecientsa Given a collection of n objects, selecting k of them to be in a set is equivalent to selectingn  k of them to not be in the set.b Suppose the n objects are numbered 1 through n.

So the total number of sets of size k is thenumber of such sets containing the rst object,cid:0n1containing the rst object,cid:0n1cid:1.k1cid:1, plus the number of such sets notknand half of which are blue.
